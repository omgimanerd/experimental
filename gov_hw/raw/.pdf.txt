Federalism According to statistics,
Americans move an average of six times
during their lives, often from state to
state. What federal laws protect them
wherever they live? If you moved to a
new state, how might laws differ?

National and State Powers
Few  confrontations  between  the  state  and
Reader’s Guide
national  governments  are  as  dramatic  as
the  one  at  the  University  of Alabama  in
1963. Never theless, national  and  state
powers  have  been  continually  redefined  through
conflict, compromise, and  cooperation  since  the
earliest days of the  republic. How do  the different
levels of government cooperate?

The Division of Powers
The Constitution  divided  government  au-
thority  by  giving  the  national  government
certain specified powers, reserving all other powers
to  the  states or  to  the people. In  addition, the na-
tional  and  state  governments  share  some  powers.
Finally, the Constitution  specifically  denied  some
powers to each level of government.
The Constitution  has  preserved  the  basic  de-
sign  of federalism, or  the  division  of government
powers, over  the  years. The American  concept  of
federalism, however, has  changed  greatly  since
1787.
Federalism  is  not  a  static  relationship  be-
tween  different  levels  of government. It  is  a  dy-
namic  concept  that  affects  everyday  decisions  at
all  levels. An  understanding  of federalism must
begin with the Constitution.

National Powers
The  Constitution  grants  three  types  of
power  to  the  national  government: ex-
pressed, implied, and  inherent  powers. Collec-
tively, these  powers  are  known  as  delegated
powers, powers the Constitution grants or dele-
gates to the national government.
Expressed Powers The expressed powers
are  those  powers  directly  expressed  or  stated 
in  the  Constitution  by  the  Founders. Most 
of these powers are  found  in  the  first  three ar-
ticles  of the Constitution. This  constitutional
