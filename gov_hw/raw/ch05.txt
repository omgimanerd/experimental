he Founders did not intend to make
Congress a privileged group, but they did
intend that the legislative branch have
more power than any other branch
of government. The Constitution emphasized the
importance of the lawmaking branch by describing
Congress in Article I. As James Madison said, Congress is “the First Branch of this Government.”
The United States Congress is a bicameral
legislature, meaning that it is made up of two
houses, in this case, the Senate and the House
of Representatives. Most of the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention agreed to a bicameral
legislature. Eighteenth-century colonial legislatures had followed the English Parliament with its
upper house and a lower house.
Today Congress plays a central role in formulating national policies. Congress initiates and approves laws dealing with everything from health
care to tax changes.

T

Congressional Sessions
Each term of Congress starts on January 3
of odd-numbered years and lasts for two
years. For example, the 107th Congress began its
term in January 2001 and the 108th Congress
began in January 2003.
Each term of Congress is divided into two
sessions, or meetings. A session lasts one year
and includes breaks for holidays and vacations.
Until the Twentieth Amendment was ratified in
1933, Congressional sessions did not formally
end until March, which left a four-month period
between the election and the formal start of new
members. This time delay was shortened when
the session start date was moved to January.
Congress remains in session until its members vote to adjourn. Neither the House nor the
Senate may adjourn for more than three days
without the approval of the other house. Also,
if Congress is adjourned, the president may
call it back for a special session if necessary.
CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS 123

▲

Division of the House
Past During sessions of the British
House of Commons, “the Government,” (shown here) led by Prime
Minister William Pitt in the 1790s,
sits on one side while the “opposition” sits on the other side. The
speaker sits in the center, between
the two parties.

Present British procedures influenced the U.S. House of Representatives. Each major political party sits
on one side of the chamber, while
the Speaker occupies a platform in
the front and center.

▲

Political Processes
How does the physical
division into political
groups help the Speaker of the House to moderate debates?

Membership of the House
With its 435 members, the House of Representatives is the larger body of Congress.
The Constitution does not set the number of representatives in the House. It simply states that the
number of House seats must be apportioned, or
divided, among the states on the basis of population. Each state is entitled to at least one seat in the
House, no matter how small its population.

Qualifications The Constitution sets the qualifications for election to the House of Representatives. Representatives must be at least 25 years old,
be citizens of the United States for at least 7 years,
and be legal residents of the state that elects them.
Traditionally, representatives also live in the district they represent.
Term of Office

Members of the House of Representatives are elected for two-year terms. Elections
are held in November of even-numbered years—for
example, 1996, 1998, and 2000. Representatives
begin their term of office on January 3 following the

124 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

November election. This means that every two
years, all 435 members of the House must run for
reelection. It also means that the House reorganizes
itself every two years. Because more than 90 percent
of all representatives are reelected, however, there is
great continuity in the House. If a representative
dies or resigns in the first session of Congress, the
state must hold a special election to fill that vacancy.
Procedures for vacancies that occur during the second session vary from state to state.

Representation and Reapportionment
In order to assign representation according to
population, the Census Bureau takes a national
census, or population count, every 10 years.
The first census was taken in 1790, and each state
was apportioned its representatives. The next
census will be in 2010. The population of each
state determines the new number of representatives
to which each is entitled—a process called reapportionment. States with slow population growth
or a population decrease may lose representatives,
while states with more rapid population growth
may gain representativees.

Originally the House had only 64 members.
Over the years, as the population of the nation
grew, the number of representatives increased.
After the 1810 census the House had 186 members.
By 1911 the House had 435 members. After the
debate sparked by the 1920 census, and concern
about the increasing size of the House, Congress
passed the Reapportionment Act of 1929 limiting
the House to 435 representatives. Now each census
determines how those 435 seats will be divided
among the 50 states.

Congressional Redistricting

After the
states find out their reapportioned representation
for the next 10-year period, each state legislature sets
up congressional districts—one for each representative. Representatives are elected from these

congressional districts. If a state is entitled to only
one representative, it has one congressional district. In most states the state legislature draws the
boundary lines for each congressional election district. The process of setting up new district lines
after reapportionment has been completed is
called redistricting.
Over the years some state legislatures abused
the redistricting power. They did so in two ways—
by creating congressional districts of very unequal
populations and by gerrymandering. During the
early 1960s, for example, there were some states in
which the largest district in the state had twice the
population of the smallest district. In these states a
person’s vote in the largest congressional districts
had only half the value of a person’s vote in the
smallest districts.

Critical Thinking What governing body has the final authority to determine whether legislative
districts are constitutional?

Redistricting Cases

In a series of decisions
during the 1960s, the Supreme Court addressed
reapportionment issues in Tennessee, Georgia, and
Alabama. In a case originating in Tennessee, Baker
v. Carr 1 (1962), the Court held that federal courts
could decide conflicts over drawing district
boundaries. Two years later, in Reynolds v. Sims 2,
the Court held that the equal protection clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment required that seats in
both houses of the Alabama state legislature be apportioned on a population basis. In Wesberry v.
Sanders 3 (Georgia, 1964), the Court ruled that the
Constitution clearly intended that a vote in one
congressional district was to be worth as much as a
vote in another district. This principle has come to
be known as the “one-person, one-vote” rule. As a
result, today each congressional district contains
about 650,000 people.

See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook:
1. Baker v. Carr case summary, page 754.
2. Reynolds v. Sims case summary, page 764.
3. Wesberry v. Sanders case summary, page 767.

126 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

Following the census of 1990, several states drew
new district lines to increase the power of ethnic or
racial minorities. This approach increased the number of minority representatives, but it also tended to
concentrate the Democratic vote, leaving neighboring districts more Republican.
The Supreme Court ruled that North Carolina’s
1992 redistricting map was unconstitutional because
it used race as the “predominant factor” in drawing
districts. North Carolina redrew its legislative districts
in 1997. These were challenged in court on similar
grounds,but in 2000 and 2001,the Supreme Court upheld the new redistricting plan. Because there are no
clear guidelines for the states on this issue, the Court
has ruled on a case-by-case basis.

Gerrymandering

Historically, state legislatures have abused their power to divide the
state into congressional districts by gerrymandering. Gerrymandering means that the political
party controlling the state government draws a
district’s boundaries to gain an advantage in
elections. Gerrymandering often results in district
boundaries that have very irregular shapes.
The term gerrymandering can be traced to

Elbridge Gerry, an early Democratic-Republican
governor of Massachusetts. Gerry had signed a redistricting plan that gave his party a big political
advantage over the Federalists. To a map of one
particularly irregular district that looked like a
salamander, artist Gilbert Stuart added a head,
wings, and claws. A newspaper editor published
the map as a cartoon and labeled it a “Gerrymander.” Federalists popularized the term.
“Packing” and “cracking” are ways to gerrymander. Packing a district means drawing the lines
so they include as many of the opposing party’s
voters as possible. Crowding the opposition’s vot-

ers into one district makes the remaining districts
safe for the majority party’s candidates. Cracking
means dividing an opponent’s voters into other
districts, to weaken the opponent’s voter base.
The Supreme Court has ruled that congressional districts must be compact and contiguous,
or physically adjoining. This requirement, plus the
one-person, one-vote ruling, has cut down on
some of the worst examples of gerrymandering.
Nevertheless, the competitive struggle of the twoparty system continues to fuel the practice of gerrymandering. Many districts today are still drawn
in irregular shapes for political reasons.

Democrats

Republicans

Independents

Critical Thinking Democrats and Republicans have each had periods of dominance in the House
and Senate. When was the most lopsided division? Why?
CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS 127

Membership of the Senate
According to the Constitution, the Senate
“shall be composed of two senators from
each state.” Thus, each state is represented equally.
Today’s Senate includes 100 members—2 from
each of the 50 states.

Qualifications The Constitution provides that
senators must be at least 30 years old, citizens of
the United States for 9 years before election, and
legal residents of the state they represent. All voters
of each state elect senators at-large, or statewide.
Term of Office

Elections for the Senate, like
those for the House, are held in November of evennumbered years. Senators also begin their terms
on January 3, after the election held the previous
November.
The Constitution provided for continuity in
the Senate by giving senators 6-year terms and by
providing that only one-third of the senators
would run for reelection every 2 years. In fact, the
Senate has more continuity than the Framers
planned because most senators win reelection.
If a senator dies or resigns before the end of
the term, the state legislature may authorize the
governor to appoint someone to fill the vacancy
until the next election. The governor may also call
a special election to fill the seat.

Salary and Benefits The Senate and the House
set their own salaries. In 1789 salaries for both houses were $6 per day. Low pay in the early years deterred some people from running for Congress.
Congress has voted itself periodic salary increases.
In 1991 it voted for a pay hike of $23,000, explaining
that the increase would be accompanied by a prohibition on honoraria—money paid for speeches.
Meanwhile, a constitutional amendment affecting legislative salaries was being considered.
Originally proposed by James Madison in 1789,
the Twenty-seventh Amendment 1 was finally ratified by the required 38 states when Michigan cast
the deciding vote on May 7, 1992. The amendment
prohibits a sitting Congress from giving itself a pay
raise. Any new congressional salary increase will
take effect after an intervening election.
Almost immediately a group of plaintiffs, including some legislators, used the new amendment
128 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

to challenge a cost-of-living adjustment to raise
salaries to $133,600 in January 1993. (Automatic
cost of living adjustments raised salaries to
$150,000 in 2002.) A United States District Court
judge had ruled that:

“

Automatic annual adjustments to congressional salaries meet both the language and
the spirit of the 27th Amendment. . . . One
way to maintain high-quality government
is to provide our elected officials with a
living wage that automatically changes to
reflect changed economic conditions.
—Judge Stanley Sporkin, 1992

”

In addition to their salaries, members of Congress enjoy a number of benefits and resources.
These include stationery, postage for official business (called the “franking privilege”), a medical
clinic, and a gymnasium.
Members also receive large allowances to pay
for their office staff and assistants, trips home, telephones, telegrams, and newsletters. All members
are entitled to an income tax deduction to help
maintain two residences, one in their home state
and one in Washington, D.C. Moreover, when they
retire, senators and representatives may be eligible
for pensions of $150,000 or more a year for life.

Privileges of Members

The Constitution
provides members of Congress certain protections
while they carry out their legislative duties. They
are free from arrest “in all cases except treason,
felony, and breach of the peace,” when they are
attending Congress or on their way to or from
Congress. Members of Congress cannot be sued
for anything they say on the House or Senate floor.
This privilege does not extend to what members
may say outside of Congress. In Hutchinson v. Proxmire 2 (1979), the Supreme Court ruled that members of Congress may be sued for libel for statements they make in news releases or newsletters.
The Senate and the House both may judge
members’ qualifications and decide whether to
seat them. Each house may refuse to seat an elected
member by a majority vote. This power of
exclusion was later defined by the Supreme Court
See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook:
1. The Constitution, pages 774–799.
2. Hutchinson v. Proxmire case summary, page 760.

in the case of Powell v. McCormack (see Supreme
Court Cases to Debate on page 131). Each house
may also “punish its own members for disorderly
behavior” by a majority vote and expel a legislator
by a two-thirds vote. Only the most serious offenses such as treason or accepting bribes are grounds
for expulsion. Members who are guilty of lesser offenses may be censured. Censure is a vote of formal disapproval of a member’s actions.

commissioner from Puerto Rico, none of whom
can vote. However, they do attend sessions, introduce bills, speak in debates, and vote in committees.

Characteristics

Nearly half the members of
Congress are lawyers. A large number of members
also come from business, banking, and education.
Why are there so many lawyers? Because lawyers by
profession deal with laws, it is logical for them to
serve as legislators. Training in law helps a legislator understand the complex legal issues that may
affect legislation.
Senators and representatives typically have been
white, middle-aged males. The average age of members of Congress is usually over 50. Slowly Congress
has begun to reflect the racial, ethnic, and gender
diversity of the general population.

The Members of Congress
Congress includes 535 voting members—
100 senators and 435 representatives. In addition, there are 4 delegates in the House—1 each
from the District of Columbia, Guam, American
Samoa, and the Virgin Islands—and 1 resident

Which house of Congress is more diverse?
CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS 129

Reelection to Congress

Membership in
Congress has changed very slowly because officeholders seldom lose reelection. One representative
put it simply: “All members of Congress have one
primary interest—to be reelected.” Beginning with
Franklin Roosevelt’s landslide presidential victories in the 1930s, incumbency helped Democrats
dominate Congress in all but a few years.
Between 1945 and 1990, about 90 percent of all
incumbents, or those members already in office,
won reelection. In some elections, many seats went
unchallenged because opponents knew that they
would have little or no chance of winning. One
analyst said that winning an election to Congress
for most members was like removing olives from
a bottle—“after the first one, the rest come easy.”
Why have incumbents been so successful? First,
incumbents find it easier to raise campaign funds
because they have worked with so many people
while representing their district. Second, many districts have been gerrymandered in the incumbent
party’s favor. Third, incumbents are better known to
voters, who see them at rallies and on television and
read about them in newspapers. Fourth, incumbents
use their position to help solve voters’ problems. Finally, incumbents win because the majority of voters
believe their incumbent best represents their views.

Campaigning Online

While television and
radio remain the dominant campaign technologies,
people running for Congress have begun using the
Internet as a campaign tool. Challengers for open
seats and incumbents in highly competitive races

are making the greatest use of the Web. Nearly all
candidates now have election Web sites that serve
as electronic brochures providing biographies, press
releases, lists of upcoming campaign events, and
other information. Candidates also use their election Web sites to recruit volunteers and to raise
campaign contributions. A few candidates have
even used their Web sites to broadcast, in real time,
campaign events such as speeches.
Not many candidates, however, have taken
advantage of the interactive capacities of the Internet.
In recent elections, for instance, only one in ten
candidates has conducted “town hall” type meetings
with voters through their Web sites. Some experts
predict more candidates will do so in the future.
Experts also forecast that congressional candidates
will make greater use of Web technologies such as
search engines, portals, and e-mail lists to identify
voters in their districts interested in particular issues
like gun control or health care. The Internet can then
be used to communicate directly with such voters
using specially targeted e-mails or Web sites. Finally,
experts anticipate more candidates will start using the
Internet to improve communications within their
campaign organizations.

Powell v.
McCormack, 1969
The Constitution gives
Congress the power to be
the “Judge of the Elections,
Returns and Qualifications of its own Members.” It establishes the age,
citizenship, and residence requirements for the House and Senate. Does the
Constitution allow Congress to judge qualifications beyond these three specific requirements? The case of Powell v. McCormack addressed this question.

CASES TO DEBATE

Background of the Case
Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., was reelected to
the House of Representatives in November 1966.
However, a congressional investigation had already
disclosed questionable activities by Powell and
members of his staff during his previous terms.
The House refused to seat Powell. In March 1967
Congress declared the seat vacant and notified the
governor of New York to order a new election.
Powell charged that he had been unlawfully
excluded from his seat in the House and brought
suit in the federal courts. Speaker John McCormack
and four other officials were named as defendants.
They responded that Congress had authority under
the Constitution to judge the qualifications of its
own members.
The federal district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction in this matter. The United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia refused to hear
the case on the grounds that it was essentially a
political question. The Supreme Court heard the
case of Powell v. McCormack in 1969. The 90th
Congress, to which Powell had been elected, was

Adam Clayton
Powell, Jr.

no longer in session. In the meantime (1968) Powell had been elected again and seated in the 91st
Congress. His lawyers now asked the Court for back
salary for the two years he was denied his seat.

The Constitutional Issue
One constitutional question was whether the
case was justiciable—could be decided by the
Court—under the Constitution. The defendants held
that the case was not justiciable by the Court because the Constitution gave Congress, not the Court,
power to judge the qualifications of its members.
Further, defendants submitted that the question was “political” and therefore not justiciable by
the Court. Finally, defendants asked whether the
Court could coerce officers of the House or issue
injunctions compelling officers or employees of the
House to perform specific acts.
Powell’s lawyers believed that Congress did not
have the power to judge the moral qualifications of
members. The Supreme Court referred to debates
at the Constitutional Convention that related to
giving Congress power to judge its members’
qualifications.

Debating the Case
Questions to Consider
1. What might be a far-reaching result if the Court
decided in favor of the Speaker?
2. What might be a far-reaching result if the Court
decided in favor of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.?

You Be the Judge
Must Congress accept a member if he or she
meets the three basic tests—age, citizenship, and
residency? Does Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., deserve
back pay and restoration of his seniority rights?

olitical division and debate is unavoidable
in democratic government. Legislators
must have freedom to express their sometimes inflammatory opinions. Rules are
necessary to help ensure fairness, to enable the legislature to conduct business, and to protect the minority.
Article I, Section 5 1, of the Constitution says:
“Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.” Thomas Jefferson compiled the first
parliamentary manual for the Senate when he was
vice president. He emphasized the importance of
rules:

P
“

It is much more material that there be a
rule to go by, than what the rule is; that
there may be a uniformity of proceeding in
business not subject to the caprice [whims]
of the Speaker or captiousness [criticisms]
of the members.
—Thomas Jefferson, 1797

”

Rules for Lawmaking
The main task of each house of Congress
is the same—to make laws. Because the
House and Senate differ in many ways, each
house has organized itself to carry out its work of
making the laws. Complex rules and a structure
of leadership enable Congress to carry out its
lawmaking duties.

Complex Rules

Each chamber has scores of
precedents based on past rulings that serve as a
guide to conducting business. The House and
Senate each print their rules every two years.
House rules are generally aimed at defining the
actions an individual representative can take,
such as limiting representatives to speaking for
five minutes or less during a debate.
See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook:
1. The Constitution, pages 774–799.

The complex rules in the House are geared toward moving legislation quickly once it reaches the
floor. House debates rarely last more than one day.
Moreover, leaders of the House of Representatives
have more power than leaders in the Senate. For
example, the rules of the House allow its leaders to
make key decisions about legislative work without
consulting other House members.

librarian in Congress. He emphasizes the importance of libraries in promoting literacy. As an
African American, Owens also supports funding
for African American colleges and aid for underprivileged students. He explains:

“

Committee Work

Committees do most of the
work of Congress. In the House, committee work
is more important than in the Senate. Because the
membership of the House is so large, its members
must organize themselves into smaller groups in
order to accomplish their work efficiently. In the
committees representatives have more influence
than on the House floor, and they have the time to
study and shape bills.
In addition, representatives tend to specialize
in a few issues that are important to their
constituents—the people in the districts they represent. For example, Major R. Owens, a representative from Brooklyn, New York, is the only trained

Making a Difference

Honor

We need more role models who will open
new possibilities for those who have been
excluded from the dreams that others take
for granted.
—Major R. Owens

”

Finally, because House members are elected
from districts, much of their time is devoted to
serving the interests of their constituents. John J.
Duncan, Jr., of Tennessee said:

“

I have a firm belief we have too many laws
on the books now. . . . I’ve made it pretty
clear I believe constituent service is most
important and is where a freshman can be
most effective.
—John J. Duncan, Jr., 1988

”

n 1944 Vernon Baker, a
25-year-old army second
lieutenant serving in World
War II, was shot in the wrist by
a German sniper. He spent two
months in a segregated hospital,
then returned to lead his men
into battle. On the morning of
April 5, 1945, Baker destroyed
two enemy bunkers, an observation post, and three machine
gun nests. His company was
nearly wiped out, but he ordered
the seven remaining men
to retreat while he drew
enemy fire. Somehow, amid
exploding shells, Lieutenant
Baker escaped.
Although the army segregated African Americans during
the war, Baker and his men
fought like heroes. Asked
why he fought so courageously

I

for a country that treated him
as a second-class citizen, Baker
replied, “I was a soldier with a
job to do, and I did it for the
men I was leading.”
Presented with the Distinguished Service Cross for his service in Italy, Baker remained in the
military after the war. When he retired from the army in 1968, he
took a job with the Red Cross,
counseling needy military families.
In 1990 Army officials reexamined their records, looking for
congressional Medal of Honor
candidates among African Americans with outstanding service in
World War II. Fifty years after his
act of bravery, Vernon Baker accepted the medal in a White
House ceremony. “It’s a great
day. We’ve all been vindicated,”
he said.

CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS 133

Speaking Frankly Members of
Congress don’t need stamps for their official
mail: their signature, real or printed, is known
as a frank and is accepted by the Post Office.
Franking cannot be used for personal
business or for political campaigns. It can be
used only on letters mailed to constituents.
Because this privilege gives incumbents an
advantage during an election year, members
of Congress can’t send out large volumes of
franked mail right before an election.

Importance of Party Affiliation

Many procedures in Congress are organized around the political
party affiliation of members. In both the House and
Senate, the Republicans sit on the right side of the
chamber, the Democrats on the left. In each house
the majority party selects the leaders of that body,
controls the flow of legislative work, and appoints
committee chairs. The power to organize the House
explains why some conservative Democrats
switched to the Republican Party when it became the
majority party in Congress after the 1994 election.
The Republican majority began sweeping
changes of House rules in 1995, promoted to make
the House more accountable. Some changes centralized power in the speakership in order to help
Republicans carry out their agenda. The new rules
provided for fewer committees, fewer staff members, term limits for chairpersons and the Speaker,
and an end to absentee voting in committees.
Despite strong resistance from the Democratic
leaders in the House, the new Republican majority
was able to push through the reforms.

House Leadership
Organized leadership coordinates the work
of the 435 individual members of the House
of Representatives. These leaders serve 6 purposes:
134 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

(1) organizing and unifying party members; (2)
scheduling the work of the House; (3) making certain that lawmakers are present for key floor votes;
(4) distributing and collecting information; (5)
keeping the House in touch with the president;
and (6) influencing lawmakers to support the policies of their political party. The Constitution provides only for the presiding officer of the House.
Other than that, the House chooses all its other
leaders.

The Speaker of the House

The Speaker of
the House is the presiding officer of the House and
its most powerful leader. The Constitution states
that the House “shall choose their Speaker and
other officers.” A caucus, or closed meeting, of the
majority party chooses the House Speaker at the
start of each session of Congress, and the entire
House membership approves the choice of Speaker.
As both the presiding officer of the House and
the leader of the majority party, the Speaker has
great power. Presiding over the sessions of the
House, the Speaker can influence proceedings by
deciding which members to recognize first. The
Speaker also appoints the members of some committees, schedules bills for action, and refers bills
to the proper House committee. Finally, the Speaker of the House follows the vice president in the
line of succession to the presidency.
Today, Speakers rely as much on persuasion as
on their formal powers to exercise influence. On a
typical day, the Speaker may talk with dozens of
fellow members of Congress. Often the Speaker
does so just to listen to requests for a favor. As former Speaker Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill once put it,
“The world is full of little things you can do for
people.” In return, the Speaker expects representatives’ support on important issues.

House Floor Leaders

The Speaker’s top assistant is the majority leader. The majority leader’s
job is to help plan the party’s legislative program,
steer important bills through the House, and make
sure the chairpersons of the many committees finish work on bills important to the party. The majority leader is the floor leader of his or her
political party in the House and, like the Speaker, is
elected by the majority party. Thus, the majority
leader is not actually a House official but a party
official.

The majority leader has help from the majority whip and deputy whips. These whips serve as
assistant floor leaders in the House. The majority
whip’s job is to watch how majority-party members intend to vote on bills, to persuade them to
vote as the party wishes, and to see that party
members are present to vote.
The minority party in the House also elects its
own leaders. These include the minority leader
and the minority whips. The responsibilities of
these leaders are much the same as those of the
majority party’s leaders, except they have no power
over scheduling work in the House.

Lawmaking in the House
To a visitor, the floor of the House of Representatives may seem totally disorganized.
Some representatives talk in small groups or read
newspapers. Others constantly walk in and out of

the chamber. Most representatives are not even on
the floor, because they are in committee meetings,
talking with voters, or taking care of other business. Representatives reach the floor quickly, however, when it is time for debate or a vote on
proposed bills.
Usually, the House starts its floor sessions at
noon or earlier. Buzzers ring in members’ offices in
the House office buildings, committee rooms, and
in the Capitol, calling representatives. The House is
normally in session from Monday through Friday.
Mondays are for routine work. Not much is done
on Friday because many representatives leave to go
to their home districts over the weekend. Thus,
most of the House’s important work is done from
Tuesday through Thursday.

Parliamentary
Procedure

ike Congress, all deliberative assemblies need rules to conduct
business in a fair and impartial
way. Rules of order had their origin
in early British Parliaments. Thomas
Jefferson’s Manual of Parliamentary
Practice (1801) provided rules for
the new United States government.
Many groups use Robert’s Rules of
Order, first published in 1876 by
U.S. army officer Henry M. Robert.
Robert’s Rules addresses such
issues as:
1. How to make a motion and how
to amend a motion
2. What rank or precedence various
kinds of motions have
3. How to table or suspend a motion

L

president signs it. According to the procedure
currently in place, to introduce a bill in the House,
representatives drop it into the hopper, a mahogany box that is accessible to all near the front
of the chamber.
After a bill is introduced, the Speaker of the
House sends it to the appropriate committee for
study, discussion, and review. Of the thousands
of bills and resolutions introduced during each
legislative term of Congress, only about 10 to 20
percent ever go to the full House for a vote. Bills
that survive the committee process are put on one
of the House calendars. Calendars list bills that are
up for consideration.
The House has five calendars. Three are used
to schedule different kinds of bills for consideration. The Union Calendar lists bills dealing with
money issues. Most other public bills are put on
the House Calendar. The Private Calendar lists
bills that deal with individual people or places. Any
bill that the House gives unanimous consent to debate out of regular order is listed on the Consent
Calendar. Finally, the Discharge Calendar is used
for petitions to discharge a bill from committee.
136 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

Activity
1. Obtain a copy of Robert’s Rules
of Order. Appoint a small group to
find rules pertaining to the items
listed above. Discuss the needs
of a small group meeting (about
the size of your class). Write rules
for such a meeting based on
these needs.
2. Choose a presiding officer for a
meeting of your government class
and a parliamentarian to enforce
the rules. Hold a meeting in which
the class determines an issue to
discuss, hears opinions from the
floor, and decides whether to take
any action.

The House Rules Committee The Rules
Committee serves as the “traffic officer” in the
House, helping to direct the flow of major legislation. It is one of the oldest House committees, and
the most powerful. After a committee has considered and approved a major bill, it usually goes to
the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee can
move bills ahead quickly, hold them back, or stop
them completely.
Because the Rules Committee has the power to
decide how and when legislation will be considered by the House, it has often been the focus of
political battles. From 1858 to 1910, the Speaker of
the House, as chair of the Rules Committee, dominated the flow of legislation. In 1911 the House revolted against Speaker Joseph G. Cannon’s
authoritarian leadership and removed him from
the Rules Committee.
In 1975 Democratic majorities in the House
once again placed the Rules Committee under
control of the Speaker. The Democratic Caucus
gave the Speaker the power to appoint, subject to
caucus ratification, all majority-party members of
the Rules Committee. A former Speaker explained:

“

The Rules Committee is an agent of the
leadership. It is what distinguishes us from
the Senate, where the rules deliberately
favor those who would delay. The rules of
the House . . . permit a majority to work
its will on legislation rather than allow it
to be bottled up and stymied.
—Speaker Jim Wright, 1987

ahead. The Rules Committee may also include a
time limit for debate on the bill and specify how
much the bill may be amended on the floor.

Other Purposes of the Rules Committee

Republicans became the majority party in the
House of Representatives in 1995. Their new
Speaker, Newt Gingrich, as minority leader in the
previous Congress had sparked an ethics investigation that resulted in Speaker Jim Wright’s resignation. Gingrich asserted the power to appoint
committee chairpersons, including the leader of
the powerful Rules Committee.

The Rules Committee also settles disputes among
other House committees. For example, the Armed
Services Committee may be considering a bill that
involves an area also covered by the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The Rules Committee can help
resolve any dispute between the two committees.
Finally, the Rules Committee often delays or
blocks bills that representatives and House leaders
do not want to come to a vote on the floor. In this
way the Rules Committee draws criticism away
from members who might have to take an unpopular stand on a bill if it reaches the floor.

Function of the Rules Committee

A Quorum for Business

”

Major
bills that reach the floor of the House for debate
and for a vote do so by a “rule”—or special order—
from the Rules Committee. As major bills come
out of committee, they are entered on either the
Union Calendar or the House Calendar in the
order received. The calendars have so many bills
that if they were taken up in that order, many
would never reach the floor before the end of the
session. To resolve this problem, the chairperson of
the committee that sent the bill to the Rules Committee may ask for it to move ahead of other bills
and to be sent to the House floor. If the Rules
Committee grants the request, the bill moves

A quorum is the
minimum number of members who must be present to permit a legislative body to take official action. For a regular session, a quorum consists of
the majority of the House—218 members. When
the House meets to debate and amend legislation it
may often sit as a Committee of the Whole. In that
case, only 100 members constitute a quorum. This
procedure helps speed the consideration of important bills. The Committee of the Whole cannot
pass a bill. Instead, it reports the measure back to
the full House with whatever changes it has made.
The House then has the authority to pass or reject
the bill.

138 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

Visitors going from the House to the Senate
are often startled by the difference. The Senate chamber is smaller than the House chamber.
Usually only a few senators attend sessions. The
Senate chamber has 100 desks—one for each senator—facing a raised platform where the president
pro tem and another senator preside over sessions.
The party leaders or their assistants stay in the
Senate chamber at all times to keep the work moving and to look after their party’s interests.

Informal Atmosphere

In the Senate, the
rules are more flexible than in the House. They
are designed to make certain that all senators
have maximum freedom to express their ideas.
For example, the Senate usually allows unlimited debate on proposed legislation. Senate rules
are spelled out in fewer than 100 pages. With
fewer rules, the Senate has a more informal atmosphere than the House. They may debate a
proposal on and off for weeks or even months
before taking action on an issue.

Senate Leaders

Leadership in the Senate
closely parallels leadership in the House, but
the Senate has no Speaker. The vice president
presides in the Senate, but may not vote except
to break a tie. Also, Senate procedures permit
individual senators more freedom in their activities. Consequently, party leaders in the
Senate may not have as much influence over other
senators as their counterparts in the House.

The Vice President

The Constitution names
the vice president as president of the Senate. The
vice president, however, does not have the same
role and power as the Speaker of the House. The
vice president may recognize members and put
questions to a vote. Because the vice president is
not an elected member of the Senate, he or she
may not take part in Senate debates. The vice president may, if the situation warrants, cast a vote in
the Senate, but only in the event of a tie. A vice
president may try to influence the Senate through
personal contact with senators, however. Many recent vice presidents previously served as senators
and thus had close relationships with their former
colleagues.
Most vice presidents find Senate duties unchallenging and devote much of their time to executive branch activities, leaving little time to preside
over the Senate. In the absence of the vice president, the president pro tempore (or president pro
tem) presides. The term pro tempore means “for

the time being.” The Senate elects this leader. The
president pro tempore is from the majority party
and is usually its most senior member.

Majority and Minority Floor Leaders

The
majority and minority leaders are the most important officers in the Senate. Elected by the members
of their political parties, the majority and minority leaders in the Senate are party officials rather
than official Senate officers. The majority leader’s
main job is to steer the party’s bills through the
Senate. To do this, the majority leader plans the
Senate’s work schedule and agenda in consultation
with the minority leader.
The majority leader is responsible for making
certain the majority party members attend important Senate sessions and for organizing their support on key bills. The minority leader develops
criticisms of the majority party’s bills and tries
to keep senators in the minority party working
together. As in the House, whips and assistant

139

whips assist the majority and minority leaders of
the Senate by making sure that legislators are
present for key votes.

How Senate Bills Are Scheduled

As in the
House, any member of the Senate may introduce a
bill. Procedures for moving bills through the Senate, however, are more informal than in the House.
Because it is smaller, the Senate has never needed a
committee like the House Rules Committee. Instead, Senate leaders control the flow of bills to
committees and to the floor for debate and vote.
They do this by consulting closely with one another and with other senators.
The Senate has only two calendars. The Calendar of General Orders lists all the bills the Senate
will consider, while the Executive Calendar schedules treaties and nominations. The Senate brings
bills to the floor by unanimous consent, a motion
by all members present to set aside formal rules
and consider a bill from the calendar. The procedure has not changed much through the years. In
1913 Massachusetts senator Henry Cabot Lodge
explained that the Senate conducted most of its
business through unanimous-consent agreements:

“

Not only the important unanimousconsent agreements which are reached often
with much difficulty on large and generally contested measures, but constantly on
all the small business of the Senate we depend on unanimous consent to enable us
to transact the public business.
—Henry Cabot Lodge, 1913

”

The Filibuster

Because the Senate usually
allows unlimited debate on any bill under consideration, one way for senators to defeat a bill they
oppose is to filibuster against it. To filibuster
means to stall the legislative process and prevent
a vote. Stall tactics include talking continuously,
delaying issues in committee, and other procedural
roadblocks.
Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina
set the record for a filibuster when he spoke against
the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18
minutes. A filibuster by a group of senators could
go on for weeks or even months.
A filibuster can be stopped when three-fifths of
the Senate (60 members) votes for cloture. Cloture
is a procedure that allows each senator to speak only
1 hour on a bill under debate. Obtaining a vote in
favor of cloture, however, is usually difficult,
especially when each party controls close to the
same number of Senate seats.
The filibuster is not commonly utilized as
a legislative tactic in the Senate today. Senate rules
now allow other matters to continue during a
filibuster, weakening the filibuster’s effectiveness.
Because of the close division of political parties in
the Senate, the simple threat of a filibuster is often
enough to delay or defeat a bill.

Politics

As in the House, Senate procedures are
organized around the members’ party affiliations.
Republicans sit on the right side of the chamber,
while Democrats sit on the left. More importantly,
the majority party controls the flow of legislative
work.

Purposes of Committees
Both the House and Senate depend upon
committees to effectively consider the thousands of bills that are proposed each session. Committees help ease the workload and are the key
power centers in Congress.
The committee system serves several important purposes. First, it allows members of Congress to divide their work among many smaller
groups. Lawmakers can become specialists on the
issues their committees consider. This system is
the only practical way for Congress to operate because no lawmaker can possibly know the details
of each of the thousands of bills introduced in
each term of Congress.
Second, from the huge number of bills introduced in each Congress, committees select those
few that are to receive further consideration.
Committees are the places in which lawmakers
listen to supporters and opponents of a bill. It is
in committees where they work out compromises, and decide which bills will or will not have a
chance to become law. Most bills never get beyond the committee stage.
Third, by holding public hearings and investigations, committees help the public learn
about key problems and issues facing the
nation. Congressional committees have called

hunger in America, airline safety, and many
other issues and concerns that have confronted the nation.
CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS 141

Kinds of Committees
Congress has four basic kinds of committees: (1) standing committees; (2) select
committees; (3) joint committees; and (4) conference committees. Congress may, however, change
the method of committee organization and the
number of committees.

Standing Committees Very early in its history, Congress set up permanent groups to oversee
bills that dealt with certain kinds of issues. These
are called standing committees because they continue from one Congress to the next. The House
and Senate each create their own standing committees and control their areas of jurisdiction,
occasionally adding or eliminating a standing
committee when necessary.
The majority party has power to write the rules
in Congress. Republicans made changes in the
structure and titles of several committees when
they became the majority in 1995. They also set sixyear term limits for committee chairpersons. The
last major realignment of standing committees in
the Senate took place in 1977.
Because the majority party in each house controls the standing committees, it selects a chairperson for each from among its party members.
The majority of the members of each standing
committee are also members of the majority party.

The V-Chip
o address the concerns of many parents who
felt that TV violence was contributing to aggressive behavior in young children, Congress
gave parents more control over home television
viewing. Use of a V-chip is part of a new communications policy that became law in 1996.
The law requires manufacturers to install a Vchip in new television sets beginning in 1998. This
computer chip enables parents to block out shows
that have been coded as violent, lewd, or inappropriate for young children.
Legislators know that widespread use of the Vchip will come only after older television sets are
no longer in service. However, the device provides

Party membership on committees is usually divided in direct proportion to each party’s strength
in each house. For example, if 60 percent of the
members of the House are Republicans, then 60
percent of the members of each House standing
committee will be Republicans. Thus, a 10-member committee would have 6 Republicans and 4
Democrats. However, the party in power in the
House will often have a super majority on the most
important committees.

Subcommittees

Nearly all standing committees have several subcommittees. Each subcommittee specializes in a subcategory of its standing
committee’s responsibility. Subcommittees, like
standing committees, usually continue from one
Congress to the next, although the majority party
may make changes. For example, House Republicans in the 104th Congress limited most committees to no more than five subcommittees. The
exceptions were Appropriations with 13 subcommittees, Government Reform and Oversight with
7 subcommittees, and Transportation and Infrastructure with 6 subcommittees.

Select Committees

From time to time, each
house of Congress has created temporary committees. Usually, these committees, called select committees, study one specific issue and report their
findings to the Senate or the House. These issues

Critical Thinking Congressional committees have changed in recent decades. The House rules
adopted in the 104th Congress limited most standing committees to no more than five
subcommittees. What is the difference between standing committees and select committees?

can include: (1) matters of great public concern,
such as organized crime; (2) overlooked problems,
such as hunger; or (3) problems of interest groups,
such as owners of small business, who claim that
Congress has not met their needs. Select committees usually cannot report bills to their parent
chamber, however.
Select committees were usually set up to last
for no more than one term of Congress. In practice, however, select committees may be renewed
and continue to meet for several terms of Congress. For this reason, both the House and Senate
have reclassified several select committees, such as
the Select Intelligence Committee, as permanent
committees. In 1993 the House terminated four select committees.

Joint Committees

Made up of members from
both the House and the Senate, joint committees
may be either temporary or permanent. Like other
committees, they have members from both political parties. These committees—such as the Joint
Economic Committee—usually act as study
groups with responsibility for reporting their findings back to the House and Senate.
In theory, joint committees coordinate the
work of the two houses of Congress. In practice,
lawmakers usually limit joint committees to handling routine matters such as are handled by the
Joint Committee on Printing, and the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress. Some joint
committees, however, have been set up to study
more volatile matters such as atomic energy,

defense, and taxation. Joint committees do not
have the authority to deal directly with bills or to
propose legislation to Congress.

Conference Committees No bill can be sent
from Congress to the president until both houses
have passed it in identical form. A conference
committee is a temporary committee set up when
the House and Senate have passed different versions of the same bill. Members of the conference
committee, called conferees, usually come from
the House and Senate standing committees that
handled the bill in question. Democrats and Republicans are represented in the same way here as
on other committees.
The job of the conference committee is to resolve the differences between the two versions of
the bill. Conference committees play a key role in
policy making because they work out a bill that
both houses may accept and send to the president.
The committee accomplishes this task by bargaining over each section of the bill. A majority of the
conferees from each house must accept the final
compromise bill—called a conference report—
before it can be sent to the floor of the House
and Senate. When the conference committee’s
report—the compromise bill it has finally worked
144 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

out—reaches the floor of each house, it must be
considered as a whole and may not be amended. It
must be accepted or rejected as it is when it comes
from the conference committee.

Choosing Committee Members
Membership in congressional committees
is extremely important to the role played
by members of Congress. Assignment to the right
committees can help strengthen a member’s career in several ways. First, membership on some
committees can increase a lawmaker’s chances for
reelection. For freshmen, the best committees
may be those that deal with bills that will benefit
a lawmaker’s state or district.
Second, membership on some committees can
mean the lawmaker will be able to influence national policy making. Committees that often help
formulate national policies include those dealing
with education, the budget, health, the judiciary,
and foreign policy. Third, some committees enable
a member to exert influence over other lawmakers
because they deal with matters important to everyone in Congress. Some of these committees include the House Rules Committee and taxation
and appropriations committees.

In the House the key committees are Rules,
Ways and Means, and Appropriations. In the Senate the most prestigious committees are Foreign Relations, Finance, and Appropriations. Assignment to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for example, will give a lawmaker a chance to directly influence American foreign policy. Senators on this
committee usually receive a great deal of publicity.

Assignment to Committees

In both the
House and Senate, the political parties assign members to the standing committees. Newly elected
members of Congress who wish to serve on a particular committee or veteran lawmakers who wish to
transfer to another committee may request assignment to the committees on which they want to serve.
Each member may only serve on a limited number
of standing committees and subcommittees.

The Committee Chairperson’s Role
Along with party leaders, the chairpersons of
standing committees are the most powerful members of Congress. They make the key decisions
about the work of their committees—when their
committees will meet, which bills they will consider, and for how long. They decide when hearings
will be held and which witnesses will be called to
testify for or against a bill. In addition, chairpersons may hire committee staff members and control the committee budget. Finally, they manage
the floor debates that take place on the bills that
come from their committees.

Since the 1970s the powers of committee
chairpersons have been limited somewhat. The
Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 made the
committee system more democratic by allowing a
majority of committee members to call meetings
without the chairperson’s approval. It also stated
that committee members who disagree with the
chairperson must have time to present their views
and that reasonable notice must be given for all
committee hearings. Rule changes in 1995 prohibited the chairperson from casting an absent member’s vote and required committees to publish all
members’ votes.

The Seniority System

The unwritten rule of
seniority traditionally has guided the selection
of chairpersons. The seniority system gave the
member of the majority party with the longest uninterrupted service on a particular committee the
leadership of that committee.
Criticism of the seniority system has resulted in
several changes. Beginning in 1971, House Republicans voted by secret ballot to select the highestranking Republican on each committee. In 1973
the Democrats, who were the majority party in the
House, adopted the same procedure. In a historic
action in 1975, House Democrats voted to replace
three senior committee chairpersons. In 1995 Republicans also bypassed several senior members up
for chairs and ruled that chairpersons of House
committees could hold their positions for no more
than three consecutive terms.

he work of Congress is so massive and
complicated that lawmakers need trained
staffs to help them do their work effectively. Staff members also carry out the
work of congressional committees. In addition, a
number of supporting agencies perform important functions for members.
House rules in 1995 cut the total of committee
staff by one-third compared to the levels of the
previous Congress. The Senate also made less dramatic cuts—a 15 percent reduction in committee
staff. At the same time Congress adopted a resolution to cut the legislative branch budget and reduced the budget of the General Accounting
Office. Such staff reductions are rare.

146 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

When Lowell Weicker of Connecticut was
in the Senate, a woman wrote to him complaining about the way an airline had handled her
dog. The dog, shipped as animal cargo, had died
in flight. One of the senator’s secretaries mentioned the letter to the press secretary, who
thought that perhaps the incident had news
value. He phoned the Federal Aviation Agency
and other government offices and found that
there had been many similar cases. After informing the senator, the secretary wrote a draft of a
bill to authorize the Transportation Department
to regulate air transport of animals. Senator
Weicker later introduced the legislation on the
floor of the Senate. The story became headlines
in Weicker’s home state, and he received many
letters of appreciation.
This story illustrates that congressional
staff members do much of the important work
on legislation. Lawmakers rely on their staffs to
help them handle the growing workload of
Congress, communicate with voters, help run
committee hearings and floor sessions, draft
new bills, write committee reports, and attend
committee meetings. Congressional staffs also

help lawmakers get reelected. Staffers help members of Congress get publicity, keep an eye on political developments back home, and write
speeches and newsletters. They also help raise
funds for election campaigns and meet with lobbyists and visitors from home.

Congressional Staff Growth
Congress has not always relied on staff to
accomplish its work. For almost 100 years,
senators and representatives had no personal aides.
Occasionally they might hire assistants out of personal funds, but Congress provided no paid staff.
Inadequate staffing had become an urgent complaint by the time Congress considered the Legislative Reorganization Act in 1946. After that the
number of staff members increased dramatically.
The House and Senate employed 2,000 personal
staff members in 1947, but more than 11,500 in
1990. Committee staff increased from 400 to more
than 3,000 in that same period.
Congressional staffs grew as lawmaking became more complex after the early 1900s. Lawmakers could not be experts on all the issues that came
before their committees or upon
which they voted in Congress. Having a large staff became one way to
get expert help. Also, the demands
that constituents placed on lawmakers increased over the years. Members of Congress needed a large
office staff simply to deal with the
many letters from people in their
states or congressional districts. In
addition to writing to their senators
and representatives, voters in increasing numbers have turned to
their lawmakers for help in solving
problems. One lawmaker explained,
“More than half my total staff time is
devoted to resolving individual difficulties that have developed between
citizens and their government.”

members work directly for individual senators and
representatives. Committee staff members work
for the many House and Senate committees.
The size of senators’ personal staffs varies because allowances to pay for them are based on the
population of the senator’s state and distance from
the capital. Senators each receive a yearly budget
to operate their offices. Most of this amount is to
pay staff salaries. About one-third of personal staff
members work in the legislators’ home states. The
rest work in Washington, D.C. Each member of the
House has an allowance to pay for a personal staff.
The House and Senate employ thousands of personal staff aides. Lawmakers can hire and fire staff
members at will.

Administrative Assistants

Lawmakers usually have three types of personal staff members in
their offices. The administrative assistant, called
an AA, is a very important legislative aide. The AA
runs the lawmaker’s office, supervises the lawmaker’s schedule, and gives advice on political matters.
A good AA also deals with influential people from
the lawmaker’s congressional district or state, who
may influence the lawmaker’s reelection.

CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS 147

Legislative Assistants Legislative assistants, or LAs, are a second type of personal staff
member. An LA makes certain that the lawmaker is
well informed about the many bills with which she
or he must deal. An LA does research, drafts bills,
studies bills currently in Congress, and writes
speeches and articles for the lawmaker.
Another important part of the LA’s job is to
assist the lawmaker in committee meetings and to
attend committee meetings when the lawmaker
cannot be present. Senators and representatives
are members of so many committees and subcommittees that they cannot possibly attend all
the committee meetings. When they do attend committee meetings, they often come in at the last
minute and briefly talk with their LA to find out
what has taken place. The LA, who has followed the
meeting and studied the bill in question, may have
prepared a short speech for the lawmaker or made
up a list of questions for the lawmaker to ask
Aiding Lawmakers

witnesses. Often the senator or representative has
not seen the speech or the questions but relies on
the LA’s judgment.
LAs also keep track of the work taking place on
the floor of Congress, as well as bills that are in
committee. While routine legislative business goes
on, the lawmaker may be in a committee meeting
or talking with voters. When the buzzer rings, signaling time for a vote, lawmakers rush to the floor
of the Senate or House from their offices or committee rooms. They may not know what the vote is
about unless it involves a major bill that has been
scheduled long in advance. As they walk, they look
for their LAs. In his book In the Shadow of the
Dome, former LA Mark Bisnow describes the
scene:

“

As the door of the “Senators Only” elevator
opened, their bosses would pour out. . . . If
they did not know what they were voting
on (votes occurred frequently throughout
the day, and it was hard to keep track), . . .
they would glance to the side to see if
someone were waiting. A staffer might
wave and run up for a huddled conference
behind a pillar; or if the senator were in a
hurry . . . he [or she] might simply expect
a quick thumbs-up or thumbs-down
gesture.
—Mark Bisnow, 1990

”

Caseworkers

Some personal staff members
are called caseworkers because they handle the
many requests for help from people in a lawmaker’s state or congressional district. In addition to
their offices in Washington, D.C., lawmakers are
likely to have offices in key cities in their home district. Caseworkers usually staff these offices.

Committee Staff

Influencing Congress Members of Congress, like Representative Maxine Waters,
depend on their legislative aides. How might
legislative assistants influence members
of Congress?

148 CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS

Every committee and subcommittee in
Congress has staff members who work for
that committee. The larger a committee is, the
more staff people it will likely have. The committee chairperson and the senior minority party
member of the committee are in charge of these
staff members. Committee staffers draft bills,
study issues, collect information, plan committee
hearings, write memos, and prepare committee

reports. They are largely responsible for the work
involved in making laws.
Some senior committee staff members
are very experienced and are experts in
the area their committee covers,
whether it be tax policy, foreign affairs, or health care. Laurence
Woodworth, who spent 32 years
on the staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, is a good example of such
an expert. As the committee’s
staff director for 14 years, he was
largely responsible for all changes
in the tax laws. Later, Woodworth left the committee to
Thomas
become assistant secretary of
Jefferson
the treasury.

Supporting Congress

Too Much Power?

The people do not elect
congressional staffers. Yet they play a key role in
lawmaking. Do they have too much influence?
Some lawmakers believe they do. Other lawmakers
disagree. They say that the staff really collects information and develops alternative courses of action for the lawmakers.

Support Agencies
Several agencies that are part of the legislative branch provide services that help Congress carry out its powers. Some of the services
these agencies provide are also available to the
other branches of government and to private citizens. Congress has created four important support
agencies.

The Library of Congress

Congress created
the Library of Congress in 1800 to “purchase such
books as may be necessary for the use of Congress.” Today, it is one of the largest libraries in the
world. This great center of information contains
more than 100 million items, including books,
journals, music, films, photographs, and maps.
As the administrator of the copyright law, the
copyright office in the Library receives two free
copies of most published works copyrighted in the
United States.
The Library has a Congressional Research Service (CRS) with hundreds of employees. Every

the Library of Congress in 1800, and in 1815
purchased Thomas Jefferson’s private library of
about 6,000 books. The Main Reading Room is

United States. Why would members of Congress

require research materials?

year, CRS answers thousands of requests for information from lawmakers, congressional staff, and
committees. CRS workers will check out anything,
from the number of kangaroos in Australia to the
crime rate in urban areas. Members of Congress
use the CRS to answer requests for information
from voters. They also use CRS for research on
matters related to bills before Congress.

Congressional Budget Office (CBO)

Congress established the CBO in 1974 to coordinate
the budget-making work of Congress, study the
budget proposals put forward by the president
each year, and make cost projections of proposed
CHAPTER 5: THE ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS 149

new programs. The CBO counterbalances the
president’s elaborate budget-making organization,
the Office of Management and Budget. CBO staff
members study economic trends, keep track of
how much congressional committees are spending, and prepare a report on the budget each April.
They also calculate how Congress’s budget decisions might affect the nation’s economy.

General Accounting Office (GAO)

Established in 1921, this agency is the nation’s watchdog
over the spending of funds Congress appropriates.
A comptroller general appointed to a 15-year term
directs the GAO. The agency has a professional
staff of about 3,300 people. They review the financial management of government programs that
Congress creates, collect government debts, settle
claims, and provide legal service.
Many GAO staff members answer requests for
information about specific programs from lawmakers and congressional committees. GAO staff members prepare reports on various federal programs
for lawmakers, testify before committees, develop
questions for committee hearings, and provide legal
opinions on bills under consideration. Almost onethird of the GAO’s work now comes from congressional requests for information.

Government Printing Office (GPO)

The
Government Printing Office is the largest multipurpose printing plant in the world. It does the
printing for the entire federal government. Every

day the GPO prints the Congressional Record, a
daily record of all the bills introduced in both
houses and of the speeches and testimony presented in Congress. Members of Congress can make
changes in speeches they have made before they
are printed in the Record. They can even have
speeches they never actually made in the House or
Senate printed in the Record.
Congressional staff members spend a good
deal of time preparing speeches for lawmakers because those words will be inserted in the Congressional Record. Thus, when voters ask about the
lawmaker’s position on a particular issue, the staff
can send a copy of the Record containing a speech
the lawmaker made on that issue to the constituent
making the request.
Another valuable publication of the Government Printing Office is the Statistical Abstract
of the United States, updated and printed every
year since 1878. Published by the Bureau of the
Census, this volume provides statistical information about population, government finances, personal income, business, agriculture, education, law
enforcement, national defense, elections, and
many other topics. It is an invaluable source of
data used by congressional staff as well as the general public.
The support agencies provide a vital function
for Congress. They have helped the legislative
branch become less dependent on the executive
branch for information. This has helped Congress
regain some of the power it held in earlier years.

WILLIAM PHILPOTT/CORBIS

APPOINTED, 1971. TWO 16YEAR-OLD GIRLS became the first
females to serve as Senate pages.
In the 1830s, Senator Daniel
Webster had appointed a 9-yearold boy to run errands and
deliver messages for him—and
the tradition of Senate pages was
born, an all-male tradition that
was not broken for more than
130 years.

UNSEATED, 1926. SMITH
BROOKHART became the only
person in U.S. history to be
unseated in the Senate
following a recount of votes.
After a long dispute, the Senate
recounted all 900,000 votes
from a 1924 race in Iowa—and
realized that the wrong man
was currently serving. In 1926 it
awarded the Senate seat to the
true winner, Daniel Steck.

1 The number of votes in the
Senate by which Texas

Analyzing Primary
Sources
In 1775, at the request of the
Continental Congress, John Adams
wrote Thoughts on Government, in
which he detailed what he believed
would be the components of an
ideal form of government. He
advocated, among other things,
a bicameral legislature. Read the
excerpt and then answer the
questions that follow.
“A representation of the people in one assembly being obtained, a question arises whether all the powers of government, legislative, executive, and judicial, shall be left in this
body? I think a people cannot be long free, nor ever happy,
whose government is in one Assembly. . . .
[L]et a [distinct] Assembly be constituted, as a mediator
between the two extreme branches of the legislature, that
which represents the people and that which is vested with
the executive power.
Let the Representative Assembly then elect by ballot, from
among themselves or their constituents, or both, a distinct
Assembly, which for the sake of perspicuity we will call a
Council. It . . . should have a free and independent exercise
of its judgment, and consequently a negative voice in the
legislature.”
1. John Adams advocated a bicameral legislature
with an upper house that would be appointed by
leaders and a lower house that would be elected
by the population. What are the benefits of having a legislative body arranged in this manner?

2. Even though Adams believed that one section of
the legislative branch should be appointed, both
houses of the U.S. Congress are directly elected.
What are the benefits of direct elections of representatives?

Participating in
Local Government
The idea of a constitutional
amendment requiring
term limits for members of
Congress has been debated
in recent years. What are the
arguments for and against a
constitutional amendment on term limits? What
is your view? Research this issue and write a letter
to the editor of your local paper expressing your
opinion for or against term limits. Be sure to include
at least three arguments that support your position
in the letter.
