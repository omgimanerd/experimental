This surprise move deprived Oklahoma of the honor its legislature was not in session. The old record was just over six months in 1804 for the Twelfth Amendment. A teens first vote In 1972, for the first time, many 18yearolds were allowed to vote. Perhaps waiting in line to vote allowed time for reflection. This text will help answer some of these basic questions. The State Aristotle, a scholar in ancient Greece, was one of the first students of government. The familiar terms country and state have basically the same meaning. The word state comes from a form of the Latin word stare, meaning to stand. The United States is one of close to 200 states in the world today. To citizens of the United States, the term state sometimes has a different meaning. The name United States was first used in 1776 when the thirteen British colonies became states by declaring their independence. At that time, each state thought of itself as a country. Fourth of July parade CHAPTER 1 PEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT 5 Changing Population and State Power Past Between 1941 and 1945 more than 700,000 African Americans moved from one part of the United States to another seeking opportunity. Present As people seek a better life, the population of the United States changes, sometimes straining existing facilities, as illustrated in this overcrowded classroom in San Antonio, Texas. Political Processes How does a shifting population affect the power of each of the states The term nation is often used to describe an independent state or country. Usually the territorial boundaries of modern states and those of nations are the same. For example, although not all citizens of France are of French descent, the territories of both the nation of France and the state of France coincide. The term nation state is often used to describe such a country. Not all groups that consider themselves to be nations have their own states. Some of these people want to break away from Canada and establish their own state. On the other hand, in Africa the populations of some national groups are divided among several African states, the result of artificial borders established during the colonial era. The popular use of the term nation, however, fits the standard definition of state. Population The most obvious essential for a state is people. States where the population shares a general political and social consensus, or agreement about basic beliefs, have the most stable governments. For example, most Americans share basic beliefs about the value of democratic government. Millions of Americans change residences each year. As a result, political power is slowly changing and being modified. Territory A state has established boundaries. The territory of the United States, like that of some other states, has grown considerably since the original thirteen states declared their independence. By purchase, negotiation, and war the United States extended its territory to the shores of the Pacific Ocean. Sovereignty The key characteristic of a state is its sovereignty. Political sovereignty means that the state has supreme and absolute authority within its territorial boundaries. In practice, of course, states with great economic strength and military capabilities have more power than other states. 0 0 1500 miles 1500 kilometers Panama Canal Zone By treaty, Panama gained control of the Panama Canal on December 31, 1999. Critical Thinking The Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War, established the original boundaries of the United States. Government is the institution through which the state maintains social order, provides public services, and enforces decisions that are binding on all people living within the state. Evolutionary Theory Some scholars believe that the state evolved from the family. This is the basis of the evolutionary theory of government origin. Gradually the large, extended family needed more organization. They also cooperated in other ways. Some scholars believe that the state was born of force. The force theory says that government emerged when all the people of an area were brought under the authority of one person or group. Divine Right Theory The notion that a god or gods have chosen certain people to rule by divine right has been important in many civilizations. By the middle of the 1600s in Europe, monarchs often referred to their right to rule as coming from God. People believed that the state was created by God, and those who were born to royalty were chosen by God to govern. To oppose the monarch was to oppose God and was considered both treason and sin. Social Contract Theory Beginning in the 1600s, Europeans challenged the rule of sovereigns who ruled by divine right. They were often supported by the writings of philosophers who believed that the origin of the state was in a social contract. Thomas Hobbes in England was one of the first to theorize on the social contract. Without an authority to protect people from one another, life was nasty, brutish, and short. The state, in turn, agreed to protect its citizens. Hobbes believed that people did not have the right to break this agreement. John Locke took the social contract a step further. In 1688 the British Parliament forced King James II out of office and invited William and Mary of Orange to rule. Locke defended Parliaments overthrow of the king. He wrote that people were naturally endowed with the right to life, liberty, and property. To preserve their rights, they willingly contracted to give power to a governing authority. When government failed to preserve the rights of the people, the people had the right to break the contract. Nearly a century later, the American colonies revolted against King George III. In declaring their independence, they cited the political philosophy of natural rights that Locke had written. In carrying out these tasks, governments must make decisions that are binding on all citizens of the state. Government has the authority to require all individuals to obey these decisions and the power to punish those who do not obey them. Legitimacy means the willingness of citizens to obey the government. Therefore, the people entrust their government with power. Many things that Americans take for granted result from services and protections offered by government. Traffic laws dictate how you drive on those roads. When you go to the store, government regulations make it likely that the groceries you buy will not poison you. Turn on your radio or TV. The program you receive will be clear because government prevents stations from interfering with each others signals. John Locke, 1690 According to the social contract theory, people need government to maintain social order because they have not yet discovered a way to live in groups See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. Two Treatises of Government, page 806. Brain storm the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative and how it would impact citizens. Recommend what speed limit should be in effect and why. But in all that people can individually do for themselves, government ought not to interfere. Governments undertake projects, such as building sewer systems, that individuals could not or would not do on their own. Governments also provide an essential service by making and enforcing laws that promote public health and safety. Government inspectors check meat and produce to prevent the sale of spoiled food. State legislators pass laws that require people to pass a driving test. Providing National Security A third task of government is to protect the people against attack by other states or from threats such as terrorism. Protecting its national security is a major concern of each sovereign state. In addition to protecting the nation from at tack, government handles normal relations with other nations. The United States Constitution gives our national government a monopoly over our nations dealings with foreign countries. Thus, our national government has the exclusive power to make treaties with other nations. Lucky 13 Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson all helped create the Great Seal of the United States. After working on the design for six years, they completed their task on June 20, 1782. Two people may argue over the boundary line between their properties. Members of a community may disagree about what is best for the group. In any group, some members may try to take unfair advantage of others. Conflict seems to be an inescapable part of group life. Governments have the power to make and enforce laws. Governments can require people to do things they might not do voluntarily, such as pay taxes or serve in the army. Without government, civilized life would not be possible. Government controls and contains conflict between people by placing limits on what individuals are permitted to do. They may intervene in the economic affairs of another nation. Governments pass the laws that shape the economic environment of the nation. The government enforces laws that protect the public safety and health. Governments also may make choices that distribute benefits and public services among citizens. Making Economic Decisions Nations vary greatly in their ability to provide their citizens with economic opportunities or resources. Even in a wealthy country like the United States, many people are poorly clothed, housed, and fed. Material scarcity is often the cause of conflict in society. Countries in which the gap between rich and poor is great may experience civil unrest.
