Defying a federal court order, Wallace had stood in a doorway at the university, blocking two African American students. Wallace attempts to block desegregation Few confrontations between the state and national governments are as dramatic as the one at the University of Alabama in 1963. Nevertheless, national and state powers have been continually redefined through conflict, compromise, and cooperation since the earliest days of the republic. Finally, the Constitution specifically denied some powers to each level of government. The Constitution has preserved the basic de sign of federalism, or the division of government powers, over the years. The American concept of federalism, however, has changed greatly since 1787. Federalism is not a static relationship be tween different levels of government. An understanding of federalism must begin with the Constitution. National Powers The Constitution grants three types of power to the national government ex pressed, implied, and inherent powers. Expressed Powers The expressed powers are those powers directly expressed or stated in the Constitution by the Founders. This constitutional National and state flags at Monument Valley, Utah CHAPTER 4 THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 95 authority includes the power to levy and collect taxes, to coin money, to make war, to raise an army and navy, and to regulate commerce among the states. Expressed powers are also called enumerated powers. While not specifically listed, implied powers spring from and depend upon the expressed powers. The flag is usually flown only from dawn to dusk. If displayed at night, it should be lighted. In a group of flags, the U.S. Inside, the flag may hang flat against the wall behind a speaker, with the stars on the left. If on a staff, it should be on the viewers left. Any other flags should be placed to the right. The flag may be flown upside down only to signal distress. Remember that, as the symbol of the United States, the flag should be treated with respect. Thus, Congress has used the implied powers to regulate nuclear power plants and to develop the space program. In The Federalist, No. 45, James Madison argued that in fact it granted few and limited powers to the national government while the states powers were many and broadly drawn. The Constitution also reserves certain powers strictly to the states. These are called reserved powers. What powers are shared by the national and state governments powers specifically, it grants to the states those powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states. The Supremacy Clause What happens when states exceed their reserved powers and pass laws that conflict with national laws Which law is supreme Article VI, Section 2, of the Constitution makes the acts and treaties of the United States supreme. For this reason it is called the supremacy clause. This clause states This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all treaties made under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby. Article VI, Section 2 No state law or state constitution may conflict with any form of national law. Article VI also re quires that all national and state officials and judges be bound to support the Constitution. State officials are not permitted to use their states re served powers to interfere with the Constitution. States create local governments such as those of cities and counties. As such, local governments get their powers from the states. Concurrent Powers The federal government and the states also have certain concurrent powers. Concurrent powers are those powers that both the national government and the states have. Examples of concurrent powers are the power to tax, to maintain courts and define crimes, and to appropriate private property for public use. These three obligations are outlined in Article IV, Sections 3 and 4.2 Republican Form of Government First, the national government must guarantee each state a republican form of government. Enforcement of this guarantee has become a congressional responsibility. When Congress allows senators and representatives from a state to take their seats in Congress, it is in effect ruling that the state has a re publican form of government.

Why did federal and state authorities have to cooperate after the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City Constitution for the national government. Of course, state actions must not conflict with any national laws. Article I, Section 9,1 enumerates those things the national government cannot do. For ex ample, the national government cannot tax ex ports, and it cannot interfere with the ability of states to carry out their responsibilities. No state can make treaties or alliances with foreign governments. 98 CHAPTER 4 THE FEDERAL SYSTEM The only extensive use of this guarantee came just after the Civil War. At that time, some Southern states had refused to ratify the Civil War amendments granting citizenship rights to African Americans. Congress ruled that these states did not have a republican form of government. It refused to seat senators and representatives from those states until the states ratified the Civil War amendments and changed their laws to recognize African Americans rights. An attack by a foreign power on one state is considered an attack on the United States. The Constitution, pages 774799. 2. The Constitution, pages 774799. During the strike, rioters had threatened federal property and interfered with mail delivery. Eisenhower sent troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957 when local officials failed to integrate public schools. Kennedy used troops at the University of Mississippi in 1962 and the University of Alabama in 1963. When one of these disasters strikes, the president often orders troops to aid disaster victims. The admission of West Virginia as a state in 1863 may be considered an exception to this rule. There are two restrictions on this power. First, as noted earlier, no state may be formed by taking territory from one or more states without the consent of the states involved and of Congress. Second, acts of admission, like all laws, are subject to presidential veto. The procedure for admission begins when Congress passes an enabling act. An enabling act, when signed by the president, enables the people of the territory interested in becoming a state to prepare a constitution. Then, after the constitution has been drafted and approved by a popular vote in the area, it is submitted to Congress. Since the original 13 states formed the Union, Congress has admitted new states under a variety of circumstances. Two states, West Virginia and Texas, were admitted under unusual circumstances. The State Capitol has stood in Oklahoma City since 1910. The Supreme Court has ruled that the president or Congress may impose conditions for admission of a state. In the case of Arizona, once it was admitted as a state, it promptly amended its constitution to restore provisions about the recall of judges that Taft had requested be deleted. The Supreme Court, however, upheld the right of Oklahoma to move the capital to Oklahoma City in 1911. The Court declared West Virginia was created from 40 western counties of Virginia that broke away when Virginia seceded from the Union. Some people have argued that the admission of West Virginia was a violation of the Constitution because the Virginia legislature did not give its consent. It held that the western representatives were the only legal acting Virginia legislature at that time. Texas won independence from Mexico and sought annexation to the United States for several years before being admitted. Texas was annexed to the United States by a joint resolution of Congress in 1845. The joint resolution provided for immediate statehood, al lowing Texas to skip the territorial period. It also stated that Texas could be divided into as many as five states with the approval of both Texas and the United States. The last two states to be admitted, Alaska and Hawaii, shortened the admission process. They each adopted a proposed constitution without waiting for an enabling act. Both were admitted in 1959. No state has more privileges or fewer obligations than any other. Each state is also legally separate from every other state in the Union. All states in the Union are bound to support the Constitution. In 1908 President Theodore Roosevelt first called the nations governors together to discuss conservation. After that the governors began to meet regularly as the Governors Conference to deal with a variety of issues. Through the NGA, states shared ideas on how to solve common problems. Working Within the System Contacting a legislator Do we truly have government by and for the people If so, how can citizens make their opinions known Can you work with in the system to change a law that you believe is unjust Your opinion will carry more influence if you join with others. Choose an appropriate means of expressing your views. To question a local ordinance, attend a city council meeting. You could write letters to the editor or prepare an editorial for a local radio or television broadcast. The Internet also offers an avenue through which citizens can speak out on an issue. Express whether you strongly agree or disagree in a letter to the news papers editor. In addition, the states play a key role in the process of amending the Constitution. The Courts as Umpire Because federalism divides the powers of government, conflicts frequently arise be tween national and state governments. In 1819, in the landmark case of McCulloch v. Maryland,1 the Supreme Court ruled on a conflict between a state government and the national government. The Courts view of this division has shifted through the years depending on the mood of the nation and on the number of conservative and liberal justices on the Court. Early in its history, the Court usually favored states power. During the Depression and the civil rights movement, the Court tended to favor a strong national government. Since the 1990s, a narrow majority of conservative justices has again generally ruled in favor of the states. For example, in United States v. Lopez (1995), the Court held that Congress had exceeded its authority over the states by passing a law banning gun possession in or near schools. Federal judges also serve as umpires of federal ism when they review the actions of state and local governments. In recent decades the power of federal judges has increased because of modern interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Broad interpretation of these words makes nearly every action by state and local officials open to questioning by a federal judge. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1.
