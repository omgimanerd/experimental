What events show that federalism has been dynamic rather than static since the 1960s Understanding Concepts Federalism How do national crises, such as war, tend to shift power to the national government Shopping the Net WASHINGTON, D.C., MARCH 19, 1998 The National Governors Association (NGA) and other groups representing local officials have decided to support national legislation that temporarily bans sales taxes on Internet transactions. Earlier, the group had asked Congress to give states the right to collect sales taxes on Internet commerce based on the tax rates of customers home states. To gain the governors support, the bills authors agreed to reduce the length of the delay from six to three years. Internet User 106 CHAPTER 4 THE FEDERAL SYSTEM The roles of state and national government officials have been defined during two centuries of developing federalism. While they deeply believed that the United States needed a strong central government to survive, they also knew that many people feared the centralization of power. The colonial experience with the power of British government was still fresh in peoples minds. This fully corresponds with the idea of a federal government. States Rightists Versus Nationalists Throughout American history, there have been two quite different views of how federalism should operate. The States Rights Position The states rights view holds that the Constitution is a com pact among the states. States rightists argue that the states created the national government and gave it only certain limited powers. Any doubt about whether a power belongs to the nation al government or is reserved to the states should be settled in favor of the states. Because the national government is an agent of the states, all of its powers should be narrowly defined. At various points in United States history, the Supreme Court has accepted this view. Under Chief Justice Roger B. Taney (18361864), the Court often supported states rights against powers of the national government. Maryland. The Nationalist Position The nationalist position rejects the idea of the Constitution as merely a compact among the states. Nationalists deny that the national government is an agent of the states. They hold that the necessary and proper clause of the Constitution means that Congress has the right to adopt any means that are convenient and useful to carry out its delegated powers. They also claim that the reserved powers of the states should not limit how the national government can use its own powers. They are U.S. In the past 30 years, public support for statehood has increased on the island. They look to the national government to take the lead in solving major social and economic problems facing the nation. The Supreme Court established the nationalist position in 1819 in McCulloch v. Maryland, but it re ally gained ground in the Court during the late 1930s. At that time, the Great Depression gripped the nation. Roosevelt responded by starting new social welfare and public works programs. It supported the expansion of the national governments powers in order to deal with the nations terrible economic problems. Growing National Government A major factor shaping the development of American federalism has been the growth in the size and power of the national government. CHAPTER 4 THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 107 Over the years this expansion came largely at the expense of the states. War Powers The national government has power to wage war. Commerce Power The Constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate commerce. Supreme Court decisions have expanded this power. For example, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbidding racial discrimination in public accommodations such as hotels and restaurants. Congress does, however, have authority to raise taxes and spend money for such purposes. The Sixteenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, gave Congress the power to tax incomes. It has given the national government much greater financial resources than any state or local government has. For example, Congress has put such heavy taxes on certain dangerous products that it is not profitable for companies to make and sell them. Second, Congress may use taxes to influence states to adopt certain kinds of programs. Federal law Congressional Desegregation Civil Rights In 1940, many businesses discriminated against African Americans. Bureau of the Census. Critical Thinking local governments in the United States decreased by 38,487. The first is by providing money through various federal grants. In 1862, for instance, Congress passed a law giving nearly 6 million acres of public land to the states for support of colleges. For example, federal money might go to a city to help improve airport runways or to a state for building new roads. Federal grants redistribute income among the states. In this way, federal grants have often worked to help reduce inequalities between wealthy and less wealthy states. States and local offices have learned that along with more federal aid comes federal control and red tape. This is because many federal aid programs provide money only if the state and local authorities are willing to meet conditions set by Congress. For example, Congress passed the Nutritional Labeling and Education Act in 1990 to establish national food labeling standards. This law took away the power of individual states to set their own requirements, even if those requirements were more strict than the new national standards. Preemption laws limit the authority of state and local governments through restraints and mandates. 1.00 or more of federal spending returned 99 or less of federal spending returned District of Columbia Source Tax Foundation, Washington, D.C. Federal revenue received from the states is not returned equally to the states. Advocates of states rights dislike the use of preemption because these laws may prevent the enforcement of a state or local law. Finally, preemption laws do not require Congress to pay for new mandates. Congress can therefore establish new programs and regulations and pass the burden of paying for them to the states. The balance of power in the federal system has shifted from time to time. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush put in place several policies that turned the responsibility for many federal programs over to state and local governments. The total amount of federal aid given to the states declined as well. The relationship between federal and state governments is dynamic and is affected by the policies of the president and of Congress. The Americans With Disabilities Act, for example, required state and local governments to build ramps .
