Federalism affects public policy making in two ways. Federalism permits states and localities to serve as proving grounds where new policies can be developed and tested. Georgia, for example, was the first state to allow 18yearolds to vote. In 1976 Colorado pioneered the use of sunset laws. Sun set laws require periodic checks of government agencies to see if they are still needed. In 1967 Florida passed a sunshine law prohibiting public officials from holding closed meetings.

In time these officials acquired political influence. As a result, some states do more than others to regulate business and industry, while some provide more health and welfare services.
