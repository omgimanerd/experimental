Although more than 20 states have passed laws limiting the service of state legislators, the reform now seems unlikely to reach Congress. Federalism and Public Policy A policy is a stated course of action. A high school principal says, It is our policy that students not park in the teachers parking lots. Federalism affects public policy making in two ways. Federalism permits states and localities to serve as proving grounds where new policies can be developed and tested. Georgia, for example, was the first state to allow 18yearolds to vote. In 1976 Colorado pioneered the use of sunset laws. Sun set laws require periodic checks of government agencies to see if they are still needed. In 1967 Florida passed a sunshine law prohibiting public officials from holding closed meetings. Policy may also originate at the national level. Sometimes the national government imposes new policies on states in which local pressure groups have resisted change. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, African Americans struggled to win voting and other civil rights in many states. Federalism and Political Parties Rival political parties are a key element of democratic government. In this way, federalism helps to lessen the risk of one political party gaining a monopoly on political powers. With such state and local bases, the party developed new policies and new leadership with which to challenge the majority party. The Democratic Party controlled the White House for only 5 of the 12 presidential terms between 1952 and 2000. Democratic organization at the state and local level, however, enabled the party to win a majority in Congress during most of that period.

They also vote on such local issues as whether to build a mass transit system in their city, whether to outlaw smoking in public places, or whether to increase property taxes for schools. Most people are more likely to become involved in political activities if they think there is a reasonable chance their efforts will bear fruit. The in creased chance for success encourages political participation. The road to nation al office often begins at the local or state level. American federalism gives citizens many points of access to government and increases their opportunities for influencing public policy. The great increase in federal programs beginning in the mid1930s called for a large bureaucracy, or organization of government administrators, to carry out legislation. As these bureaucrats gained expertise, they offered more and more ideas. Political writer Samuel H. Samuel H. The increase in federal programs also changed the political relationship of state and federal officials. C., to keep up with events and to stay in touch with law makers. In time these officials acquired political influence. As a result, some states do more than others to regulate business and industry, while some provide more health and welfare services. Because states can create different economic and political environments, Americans have a wide range of choices regarding the conditions under which they want to live, depending upon which state they live in.
