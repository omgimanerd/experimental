Pressured by constituents, senators decided to hand over a few perks. National Airport, however R The United States Capitol he Founders did not intend to make Congress a privileged group, but they did intend that the legislative branch have more power than any other branch of government. The Constitution emphasized the importance of the lawmaking branch by describing Congress in Article I. As James Madison said, Congress is the First Branch of this Government. The United States Congress is a bicameral legislature, meaning that it is made up of two houses, in this case, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Most of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention agreed to a bicameral legislature. Today Congress plays a central role in formulating national policies. Congress initiates and approves laws dealing with everything from health care to tax changes. For example, the 107th Congress began its term in January 2001 and the 108th Congress began in January 2003. Each term of Congress is divided into two sessions, or meetings. A session lasts one year and includes breaks for holidays and vacations. This time delay was shortened when the session start date was moved to January. Congress remains in session until its members vote to adjourn. Neither the House nor the Senate may adjourn for more than three days without the approval of the other house. Also, if Congress is adjourned, the president may call it back for a special session if necessary. The speaker sits in the center, between the two parties. Present British procedures influenced the U.S. House of Representatives. Each major political party sits on one side of the chamber, while the Speaker occupies a platform in the front and center. Political Processes How does the physical division into political groups help the Speaker of the House to moderate debates Membership of the House With its 435 members, the House of Representatives is the larger body of Congress. The Constitution does not set the number of representatives in the House. It simply states that the number of House seats must be apportioned, or divided, among the states on the basis of population. Each state is entitled to at least one seat in the House, no matter how small its population. Qualifications The Constitution sets the qualifications for election to the House of Representatives. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be citizens of the United States for at least 7 years, and be legal residents of the state that elects them. Traditionally, representatives also live in the district they represent. This means that every two years, all 435 members of the House must run for reelection. It also means that the House reorganizes itself every two years. Because more than 90 percent of all representatives are reelected, however, there is great continuity in the House. If a representative dies or resigns in the first session of Congress, the state must hold a special election to fill that vacancy. Procedures for vacancies that occur during the second session vary from state to state. Representation and Reapportionment In order to assign representation according to population, the Census Bureau takes a national census, or population count, every 10 years. The first census was taken in 1790, and each state was apportioned its representatives. The next census will be in 2010. Originally the House had only 64 members. Over the years, as the population of the nation grew, the number of representatives increased. By 1911 the House had 435 members. After the debate sparked by the 1920 census, and concern about the increasing size of the House, Congress passed the Reapportionment Act of 1929 limiting the House to 435 representatives. Now each census determines how those 435 seats will be divided among the 50 states. Representatives are elected from these congressional districts. If a state is entitled to only one representative, it has one congressional district. In most states the state legislature draws the boundary lines for each congressional election district. The process of setting up new district lines after reapportionment has been completed is called redistricting. Over the years some state legislatures abused the redistricting power. They did so in two ways by creating congressional districts of very unequal populations and by gerrymandering. During the early 1960s, for example, there were some states in which the largest district in the state had twice the population of the smallest district. In these states a persons vote in the largest congressional districts had only half the value of a persons vote in the smallest districts.

It will be adjusted after the census of 2010. In a case originating in Tennessee, Baker v. Carr 1 (1962), the Court held that federal courts could decide conflicts over drawing district boundaries. Two years later, in Reynolds v. Sims 2, the Court held that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required that seats in both houses of the Alabama state legislature be apportioned on a population basis. Sanders 3 (Georgia, 1964), the Court ruled that the Constitution clearly intended that a vote in one congressional district was to be worth as much as a vote in another district. As a result, today each congressional district contains about 650,000 people. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. Baker v. Carr case summary, page 754. 2. Reynolds v. Sims case summary, page 764. 3. Sanders case summary, page 767. This approach increased the number of minority representatives, but it also tended to concentrate the Democratic vote, leaving neighboring districts more Republican. North Carolina redrew its legislative districts in 1997. Gerrymandering Historically, state legislatures have abused their power to divide the state into congressional districts by gerrymandering. Gerrymandering means that the political party controlling the state government draws a districts boundaries to gain an advantage in elections. Gerrymandering often results in district boundaries that have very irregular shapes. Gerry had signed a redistricting plan that gave his party a big political advantage over the Federalists. To a map of one particularly irregular district that looked like a salamander, artist Gilbert Stuart added a head, wings, and claws. A newspaper editor published the map as a cartoon and labeled it a Gerrymander. Federalists popularized the term. Packing and cracking are ways to gerrymander. The Supreme Court has ruled that congressional districts must be compact and contiguous, or physically adjoining. Many districts today are still drawn in irregular shapes for political reasons.

Democrats Republicans Independents Critical Thinking Democrats and Republicans have each had periods of dominance in the House and Senate. Thus, each state is represented equally. Qualifications The Constitution provides that senators must be at least 30 years old, citizens of the United States for 9 years before election, and legal residents of the state they represent. Senators also begin their terms on January 3, after the election held the previous November. In fact, the Senate has more continuity than the Framers planned because most senators win reelection. If a senator dies or resigns before the end of the term, the state legislature may authorize the governor to appoint someone to fill the vacancy until the next election. The governor may also call a special election to fill the seat. Salary and Benefits The Senate and the House set their own salaries. In 1789 salaries for both houses were 6 per day. Low pay in the early years deterred some people from running for Congress. Congress has voted itself periodic salary increases. Meanwhile, a constitutional amendment affecting legislative salaries was being considered. The amendment prohibits a sitting Congress from giving itself a pay raise. Any new congressional salary increase will take effect after an intervening election. (Automatic cost of living adjustments raised salaries to 150,000 in 2002.) A United States District Court judge had ruled that Automatic annual adjustments to congressional salaries meet both the language and the spirit of the 27th Amendment . These include stationery, postage for official business (called the franking privilege), a medical clinic, and a gymnasium. Members also receive large allowances to pay for their office staff and assistants, trips home, telephones, telegrams, and newsletters. All members are entitled to an income tax deduction to help maintain two residences, one in their home state and one in Washington, D.C. Moreover, when they retire, senators and representatives may be eligible for pensions of 150,000 or more a year for life. Privileges of Members The Constitution provides members of Congress certain protections while they carry out their legislative duties. They are free from arrest in all cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, when they are attending Congress or on their way to or from Congress. Members of Congress cannot be sued for anything they say on the House or Senate floor. This privilege does not extend to what members may say outside of Congress. In Hutchinson v. The Senate and the House both may judge members qualifications and decide whether to seat them. Each house may refuse to seat an elected member by a majority vote. This power of exclusion was later defined by the Supreme Court See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774799. 2. Hutchinson v. McCormack (see Supreme Court Cases to Debate on page 131). Only the most serious offenses such as treason or accepting bribes are grounds for expulsion. Members who are guilty of lesser offenses may be censured. Censure is a vote of formal disapproval of a members actions. However, they do attend sessions, introduce bills, speak in debates, and vote in committees. Characteristics Nearly half the members of Congress are lawyers. Why are there so many lawyers Because lawyers by profession deal with laws, it is logical for them to serve as legislators. Training in law helps a legislator understand the complex legal issues that may affect legislation. The average age of members of Congress is usually over 50. Slowly Congress has begun to reflect the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the general population. Critical Thinking Congress is changing slowly to reflect Americas diverse population. Between 1945 and 1990, about 90 percent of all incumbents, or those members already in office, won reelection. In some elections, many seats went unchallenged because opponents knew that they would have little or no chance of winning. Why have incumbents been so successful First, incumbents find it easier to raise campaign funds because they have worked with so many people while representing their district. Third, incumbents are better known to voters, who see them at rallies and on television and read about them in newspapers. Fourth, incumbents use their position to help solve voters problems. Finally, incumbents win because the majority of voters believe their incumbent best represents their views. Campaigning Online While television and radio remain the dominant campaign technologies, people running for Congress have begun using the Internet as a campaign tool. Challengers for open seats and incumbents in highly competitive races are making the greatest use of the Web. Nearly all candidates now have election Web sites that serve as electronic brochures providing biographies, press releases, lists of upcoming campaign events, and other information. Candidates also use their election Web sites to recruit volunteers and to raise campaign contributions. A few candidates have even used their Web sites to broadcast, in real time, campaign events such as speeches. Not many candidates, however, have taken advantage of the interactive capacities of the Internet. In recent elections, for instance, only one in ten candidates has conducted town hall type meetings with voters through their Web sites. Some experts predict more candidates will do so in the future. Experts also forecast that congressional candidates will make greater use of Web technologies such as search engines, portals, and email lists to identify voters in their districts interested in particular issues like gun control or health care. The Internet can then be used to communicate directly with such voters using specially targeted emails or Web sites. Finally, experts anticipate more candidates will start using the Internet to improve communications within their campaign organizations.

Main Idea In a graphic organizer similar to the one below, compare the qualifications for representatives House Senate and senators. 2. 3. 4. How does Congress reapportion House seats among the states every ten years 5. Making Inferences Members of Congress spend part of their time working for reelection. Powell v. McCormack, 1969 The Constitution gives Congress the power to be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members. It establishes the age, citizenship, and residence requirements for the House and Senate. Does the Constitution allow Congress to judge qualifications beyond these three specific requirements The case of Powell v. McCormack addressed this question. However, a congressional investigation had already disclosed questionable activities by Powell and members of his staff during his previous terms. The House refused to seat Powell. In March 1967 Congress declared the seat vacant and notified the governor of New York to order a new election. Powell charged that he had been unlawfully excluded from his seat in the House and brought suit in the federal courts. Speaker John McCormack and four other officials were named as defendants. They responded that Congress had authority under the Constitution to judge the qualifications of its own members. The federal district court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction in this matter. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia refused to hear the case on the grounds that it was essentially a political question. The Supreme Court heard the case of Powell v. McCormack in 1969. The 90th Congress, to which Powell had been elected, was Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. In the meantime (1968) Powell had been elected again and seated in the 91st Congress. His lawyers now asked the Court for back salary for the two years he was denied his seat. Finally, defendants asked whether the Court could coerce officers of the House or issue injunctions compelling officers or employees of the House to perform specific acts. The Supreme Court referred to debates at the Constitutional Convention that related to giving Congress power to judge its members qualifications. Debating the Case Questions to Consider 1.
