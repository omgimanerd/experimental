Senators handle issues of specific interest to them in their committees, but they also deal with many other issues on the floor, where there is plenty of time for debate. Senators, who represent entire states, are expected to know something about and deal with many issues from national defense to social issues to farming. At first, Cl e. The Senate chamber is smaller than the House chamber. Usually only a few senators attend sessions. Informal Atmosphere In the Senate, the rules are more flexible than in the House. They are designed to make certain that all senators have maximum freedom to express their ideas. For example, the Senate usually allows unlimited debate on proposed legislation. Senate rules are spelled out in fewer than 100 pages. With fewer rules, the Senate has a more informal atmosphere than the House. They may debate a proposal on and off for weeks or even months before taking action on an issue. Senate Leaders Leadership in the Senate closely parallels leadership in the House, but the Senate has no Speaker. The vice president presides in the Senate, but may not vote except to break a tie. Also, Senate procedures permit individual senators more freedom in their activities. Consequently, party leaders in the Senate may not have as much influence over other senators as their counterparts in the House. The Vice President The Constitution names the vice president as president of the Senate. The vice president, however, does not have the same role and power as the Speaker of the House. The vice president may recognize members and put questions to a vote. Because the vice president is not an elected member of the Senate, he or she may not take part in Senate debates. The vice president may, if the situation warrants, cast a vote in the Senate, but only in the event of a tie. A vice president may try to influence the Senate through personal contact with senators, however. Many recent vice presidents previously served as senators and thus had close relationships with their former colleagues. The Senate elects this leader. Majority and Minority Floor Leaders The majority and minority leaders are the most important officers in the Senate. Elected by the members of their political parties, the majority and minority leaders in the Senate are party officials rather than official Senate officers. To do this, the majority leader plans the Senates work schedule and agenda in consultation with the minority leader. The majority leader is responsible for making certain the majority party members attend important Senate sessions and for organizing their support on key bills. Past In 60 B.C., Cato the Younger initiated a filibuster to block Caesars election as consul. Legislative Techniques Often senators simply threaten to filibuster to defeat legislative bills. Why would these threats work 139 whips assist the majority and minority leaders of the Senate by making sure that legislators are present for key votes. How Senate Bills Are Scheduled As in the House, any member of the Senate may introduce a bill. Procedures for moving bills through the Senate, however, are more informal than in the House. Because it is smaller, the Senate has never needed a committee like the House Rules Committee. Instead, Senate leaders control the flow of bills to committees and to the floor for debate and vote. They do this by consulting closely with one another and with other senators. The Senate has only two calendars. The Calendar of General Orders lists all the bills the Senate will consider, while the Executive Calendar schedules treaties and nominations. The Senate brings bills to the floor by unanimous consent, a motion by all members present to set aside formal rules and consider a bill from the calendar. The procedure has not changed much through the years. Henry Cabot Lodge, 1913 The Filibuster Because the Senate usually allows unlimited debate on any bill under consideration, one way for senators to defeat a bill they oppose is to filibuster against it. To filibuster means to stall the legislative process and prevent a vote. Stall tactics include talking continuously, delaying issues in committee, and other procedural roadblocks. A filibuster by a group of senators could go on for weeks or even months. Cloture is a procedure that allows each senator to speak only 1 hour on a bill under debate. Obtaining a vote in favor of cloture, however, is usually difficult, especially when each party controls close to the same number of Senate seats. The filibuster is not commonly utilized as a legislative tactic in the Senate today. Senate rules now allow other matters to continue during a filibuster, weakening the filibusters effectiveness. Because of the close division of political parties in the Senate, the simple threat of a filibuster is often enough to delay or defeat a bill. Politics As in the House, Senate procedures are organized around the members party affiliations. Republicans sit on the right side of the chamber, while Democrats sit on the left. More importantly, the majority party controls the flow of legislative work.
