Nearly half of the text of the Constitution is contained in Article Ian indication that the Framers intended for Congress to play the central role in governing the nation. The specific nature of that role has developed and changed over time. The last clause (18) of Section 8 gives Congress power to do whatever is necessary and proper to carry out its other powers. The first major conflict was between those who believed in a strict construction, or interpretation, of the Constitution and those who believed in a loose construction. When Congress created the Second Bank of the United States in 1816, loose constructionists See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774 799. Strict constructionists, who believed that Congress did not have the power to charter such a bank, support ed the state of Maryland when it placed a tax on the notes of the federal bank. James McCulloch, a teller at the Second Banks branch in Baltimore, issued notes on which the tax had not been paid. Maryland filed suit against McCulloch. The Supreme Court reversed the decision, supporting the loose constructionists. One important constitutional limit on congressional power is the Bill of Rights. Congress may use taxes for many purposes. For example, taxes on narcotics are meant to protect public health. Article I, Section 7, says All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. Revenue bills, laws for raising money, start in the House and then go to the Senate. Critical Thinking The powers, structure, and procedures of Congress are defined in detail in the Constitution, whereas the duties of the president and the Supreme Court are not. How has Congress used the commerce clause to prevent discrimination in restaurants, hotels, and other public accommodations 159 156166 CH06S1860053 12104 242 AM Page 160 any revenue bills introduced in Congress would originate there. It has developed through usage. Over the years Congress has used its taxing and spending authority to expand its regulatory powers. Moreover, by levying heavy taxes on products such as tobacco that it considers undesirable, Congress may discourage their use. For example, cutting individual income taxes to stimulate the economy gives tax payers more money to spend. Congress does this in various ways. When people buy savings bonds, Treasury bills, or Treasury notes, they are lending the government money. In return, the government promises to repay buyers with interest at the end of a specified period of time3 months to 30 years, depending on the type of security. This debt, almost 1 trillion in 1980 and about 3.2 trillion in 1990, reached almost 6 trillion in 2000. Although the Constitution does not restrict government borrowing, since 1917 Congress has attempted to set an annual limit on the national debt. In addition, Minimum Wage Laws W hat pay should you expect when you look for a job Generally, employers must pay a standard minimum wage set by federal law. However, many exceptions exist. Other exceptions include workers who receive tips and seasonal employees. Finally, federal law allows states to pass laws 160 that can be more generous than the minimum wage. The money powers of Congress also include the authority to make laws concerning bankruptcy legal proceedings to administer the assets of a person or business that cannot pay its debts. Despite this authority, for more than a century Congress generally left bankruptcy matters to the states. In this clause the Founders provided what has become one of the most sweeping powers of government. Gibbons v. Ogden The landmark decision on this subject came in Gibbons v. Ogden (1824). The state of New York had granted Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston the exclusive right to operate steamboats on New York waters. The Constitution, pages 774 799. Constitutional Interpretations The ruling in Gibbons v. Ogden opened up trade between New York and New Jersey. Within a short time dozens of steamboats ferried passengers and freight across the Hudson River. How did this Supreme Court ruling affect states control of economic activities government. Ogden sued Gibbons, and the state of New York held that Gibbons could not sail in its waters. The argument for state control was that commerce involved only products. The long list of such activities includes broadcasting, banking and finance, and air and water pollution. Congress has used its power over interstate commerce to set policy in many other areas, too. United States One of the most significant applications of the commerce clause has been in the area of civil rights. In 1964 Congress used its power to regulate inter state commerce to pass the landmark Civil Rights Act. This law prohibited discrimination in places of public accommodation such as restaurants, hotels, and motels. It also prohibited job discrimination. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the justices disagreed. In Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States (1964),1 the Court noted that public places of accommodation served interstate travelers and sold food that had crossed state lines. Justice Tom C. Congress shares foreign policy and national defense responsibilities with the president. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States case summary, page 759. Analyze and evaluate the consequences of this decision on the physical environment of the region. This law forbids the president to commit American forces to combat for more than 60 days without congressional notification within 48 hours. Every president since the acts passage has protested its constitutionality. During this period presidents used military force in Cambodia (1975), Iran (1980), Lebanon (1982), Grenada (1983), Libya (1986), the Persian Gulf (1987), Panama (1989), Iraq (19912004), Somalia (1993), Haiti (1994), the Balkans (1995), Yugoslavia (1999), and Afghanistan (20012004). Most of these were quick strikes with little warning. Nevertheless, in most cases the president notified Congress of the action. The Founders envisioned such property as military bases and government buildings. Other Legislative Powers Article I, Section 8,1 gives Congress the power to grant copyrights and patents. Under the present law, this period is the lifetime of the creator plus 50 See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774 799. Vietnam War hat years. A patent is the exclusive right of an inventor to manufacture, use, and sell his or her invention for a specific period, currently 17 years (after which a patent may be renewed). Article I, Section 8, also grants Congress the power to establish a post office and federal courts. Congress has also used its postal power to combat criminal activity using the mail for any illegal act is a federal crime. The Power to Choose a President The Constitution requires a joint session of Congress to count the Electoral College votes. Each states House delegation has one vote. If a majority of the House votes to impeach a public official, the Senate conducts the trial. When the impeachment proceedings involve a president, the Chief Justice of the United States presides. However, the Senate acquitted President Andrew Johnson by only one vote in 1868. President Richard Nixon would have been the second president impeached had he not resigned in 1974. During the Senate trial, Senators considered whether the charges against President Clinton, if proven, were serious enough to warrant removal from office. The Confirmation Power The Senate has the power to approve presidential appointments of federal officials. It is, therefore, possible that the vice president could be from a different party than the president. Only two times in American history has no presidential candidate captured a majority of the electoral votes. In 1800 the House elected Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr, and in 1824 it chose John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson. During the 1970s, two vice presidents gained office under this amendment. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774 799. The Senate has rejected about 20 percent of Court nominations. The Ratification Power Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution gives the Senate the exclusive power to ratify treaties between the United States and other nations. This power is one of the key ways in which Congress helps shape foreign policy. This opposition prevented a vote, and the treaty was not ratified. These agreements do not require Senate approval. Such a convention has never been called. This method, however, raises important constitutional questions. Congress has considered, but not acted on, measures that would limit constitutional conventions to the issues pro posed in state petitions to Congress. The states have approved 27 proposed amendments and have failed to ratify only 6.

Drawing Conclusions Do you think Gibbons v. Ogden provided a basis for the Supreme Courts position in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States that a hotel is a part of interstate commerce Explain. Constitutional Interpretations Research legislation that Congress passed in a recent session. Identify any bills you believe were based on the power to regulate interstate commerce. Draw a political cartoon supporting or criticizing the legislation. Kuhn et al., 1972 With teams from New York to California, professional baseball is not only a sport but also a business engaged in interstate commerce. Is baseball subject to federal antitrust laws like other businesses Do baseball players have the right to act as free agents and make their own contracts with the team that will pay the most The case of Flood v. Kuhn dealt with these questions. Curt Flood Background of the Case In twelve seasons with the St. In 1969, without consulting him, St. Flood asked that he be allowed to act as a free agent. The commissioner refused, stating that base balls reserve clause meant that each player was tied indefinitely to one club, unless that club want ed to trade the player. Flood sat out the 1970 season and took his case to the courts. Two lower courts ruled in favor of the owners. Supported by the players union, Flood appealed. In 1972 the case came to the Supreme Court. By then Curt Flood had left baseball and never played again. In 1922 in Federal Baseball Club v. Furthermore, it stated that Congress had al lowed baseball to develop exempt from antitrust laws rather than subject to them. Debating the Case Debating the Case Questions to Consider 1. What could be the consequences for baseball if the Court ruled in favor of Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals 3. To rule in Curt Floods favor the Court would have to overturn its ruling in the earlier cases.

Investigations may last for several days or go on for months. Congressional investigations occur for many reasons. In 1998 the Senate Finance Committee opened hearings into the collection methods of the Internal Revenue Service. Congressional Powers and Witness Rights Although congressional investigations are not trials, Congress has several powers that help committees collect evidence. A subpoena is a legal order that a person appear or produce requested documents. Congress makes great use of this power. Persons found in contempt of Congress may be arrested and jailed. Until recent years, witnesses called to testify in person before a congressional committee had few rights. We w ill determine what rights you have and what rights you do not have before the committee. Today this situation has changed, and witness es have important rights when appearing before a congressional committee. In Watkins v. The Court stated See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. Watkins v. United States case summary, page 767. They cannot be subjected to unreasonable search and seizure. Immunity is freedom from prosecution for witnesses whose testimony ties them to illegal acts. Of course, the Fifth Amendment states that people cannot be forced to testify against themselves. Those who refuse may be held in contempt and jailed. A Senate committee investigated charges against officials in the Reagan administration. They were charged with selling arms to Iran and using the money to finance a guerrilla war in Nicaragua. North implicated the presidents national security adviser and others. North was tried and convicted. In exercising its oversight power, congressional committees keep watch over these agencies of the executive branch. Congress makes the laws. The job of the executive branch is to carry them out. In doing so, the executive branch has the power to decide what legislation means and how it should be put into effect. Through its power of legislative oversight, Congress can check on how the executive branch is administering the law. Congress has defined its oversight functions in several laws. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 calls for Congress to exercise continuous watchfulness over executive agencies. The committee hearings focused on how American politics and policies may have been inappropriately influenced. Instead, legislative oversight usually occurs in bits and pieces as congressional staffs and committees go about their business. There are several reasons that legislative over sight is not carried out consistently. Second, lawmakers know there are not many votes to be gained from most oversight activities. As one lawmaker aptly put it, Where there is publicity to be gained, there is oversight to be had. Third, the language of some laws is so vague that it is very difficult to judge exactly what they mean. Finally, committees sometimes come to favor the federal agencies they are supposed to oversee. In such cases there exists a danger that a committee may not engage in careful, critical oversight of an agency. Congressional Limits on Executive Activities Congress exercises its oversight power in several ways. The 1946 Employment Act, for example, requires the president to send Congress an annual report on the nations economy. During a recent term of Congress, federal agencies submit ted more than 1,000 such reports to Capitol Hill. Prior to the new rules, deaf people could become pilots in the United States if they used airports that did not require radio contact. The pro posed rules were really the result of a misunderstanding. I thought that most deaf people could speak and read lips, Lynch said. Robin made me realize that was not always the case. Lynch said the ruling was not intended to keep deaf people from flying. The power of Congress to appropriate money provides another means of oversight. Each year Congress reviews the budgets of all agencies in the executive branch. This review allows Congress to shape public policy by expanding, reducing, or eliminating certain programs. For years Congress used the legislative veto, in which Congress wrote provisions into some laws that allowed it to review and cancel actions of the executive agencies that carried out those laws. In 1983 the Supreme Court ruled in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Independent Counsel In 1978 Congress passed the Ethics in Government Act in an attempt to ensure that allegations of wrongdoing by high government officials would receive fair investigation. Support for the law eroded, however, as many people complained Special Delivery Sometimes, extreme measures are taken to deliver a congressional bill to the president for his signature. A White House aide took a commercial flight from Washington, D.C., to the nation of Brunei to give President Clinton a resolution that needed to be signed no later than November 15, 2000. The funding bill allowed government operations to continue until Congress reconvened. In 1999 Congress let the law expire and gave the Attorney General sole power to conduct ethics investigations of top officials. Main Idea Using a graphic organizer like the one shown, identify the steps Congress can take 2. 2. Define subpoena, perjury, contempt, immunity, legislative veto. 3. Identify Watkins v. 4. Identify three congressional investigations that focused on the executive branch. 1. Critical Thinking 5. Prepare a news broadcast to present to the class in which you analyze the purpose of the investigation and its findings. You might want to include interviews as well. Nevertheless, they did create a system of checks and balances that can result in a government stalemate. When the Congress refuses to cooperate, the president may be frustrated. Overriding a presidential veto requires a two thirds majority in each house of Congress, which usually is difficult to obtain. Consequently, a veto or even the threat of one is an important legislative power the president exercises. Those who propose major new programs w ill almost surely come into conflict with the legislative branch. For example, the president may threaten a veto, arguing that a particular bill spends too much money and would spur inflation harmful to the nation. Some members of Congress may co operate to in attempting amend the bill or override a veto because their states or districts would benefit from the bill. This is especially evident when the different par ties control the White House and Congress. In recent decades the presidents party rarely has controlled both houses of Congress, so conflict between the branches has increased. The legislative process slowed considerably in 1995 when President Clinton, a Democrat, faced Re publican majorities in Congress. The question in the next two years, will be whether that lack of mandate for either side will foster cooperation to get things done or positioning to do battle in the next election. Curtis B. According to the cartoon, is gridlock a problem that is quickly or easily resolved Explain. Organization as a Cause of Conflict The organization of Congress provides many weapons to those who want to resist a legislative proposal of the president. Even when congressional leaders support the president, they may struggle to push presidential initiatives through Congress. Because the basic shape of legislation is set in committees and subcommittees, the committee system also may be a weapon against the president. Committee chairpersons are powerful members of Congress, and they use their positions to influence bills. At best, they have only eight years to accomplish their agenda. Adams Jefferson Madison Monroe J.Q. Harrison Tyler Polk Taylor Fillmore Pierce Buchanan Lincoln A. Johnson Grant Hayes Garfield Arthur Cleveland (1st term) B. Harrison Cleveland (2d term) McKinley T. Roosevelt Taft Wilson Harding Coolidge Hoover F. Roosevelt Truman Eisenhower Kennedy L. Johnson Nixon Ford Carter Reagan G.H.W. Bush Clinton G.W. Critical Thinking Early presidents often vetoed legislation they thought was unconstitutional. Most can look forward to being reelected for many terms. Consequently, members of Congress have political timetables quite different from the president. Thus, law makers in both houses may not be eager to act on legislation that does not directly benefit their states or districts. The third year, you lose votes . At times, however, strong presidents such as Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt challenged congressional supremacy. The system of checks and balances makes it likely that the president and Congress will always compete for power. Which branch will dominate in any specific period depends on many factors, including the political issues of the time and the leaders in Congress and the executive branch. President Franklin D. Roosevelt gained vast authority during the Great Depression and World War II. In 1933 Congress empowered the president to close the nations banks. Presidents must notify Congress when they intend to declare a national emergency. A state of emergency now cannot last more than one year unless the president repeats the process. Because of this, by the early 1970s Congress had slipped into the role of merely reacting to budget proposals. The law requires that appropriated funds be spent unless the president requests and both houses of Congress agree that the monies not be spent. Crisis and Power Additional Powers During World War II, President Franklin D. The veto was not widely used, however, until Congress reasserted its authority in the 1970s. Many members of Congress argued that the device was an effective check on the executive branch. Presidents have called the legislative veto a challenge to their authority. Since the Supreme Court ruling, Congress has searched for a constitutional alternative to the legislative veto. LineItem Veto The Constitution provides for a presidential veto of entire bills. Most governors, however, can veto parts of bills, letting the rest be come law. Sentiment for giving the president such veto power was strong in the mid1990s. Signed into law by President Clinton, the bill authorized the president to veto spending items and certain limited tax breaks. This act went into effect in 1997. The Supreme Court threw out this challenge but later ruled on the constitutional merits of the legislation. If there is to be a new procedure in which the President will play a different role such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution, Stevens concluded.
