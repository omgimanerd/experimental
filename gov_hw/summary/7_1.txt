<<<<<<< HEADS e c t i o n 1 S e c t i o n 1 How a Bill Becomes a Law In 1957 the Civil Rights Bill was one of many Readers Guide bills introduced in Congress. Unlike a majority of the bills introduced that year, and against the backdrop of a lengthy filibuster, it passed. During each 2year term of Congress, thousands of bills are introduced. The president, federal agencies, labor unions, business groups, and individual citizens all look to Congress to pass laws favorable to their various interests. Of the thousands of bills introduced in each session, only a few hundred become laws. Most die in Congress, and some are vetoed by the president. In this section you will find out how the law making process actually works. First you will look at the different forms new legislation may take. Then you will learn about the steps a bill must go through in order to become a law. Lately, however, their numbers have declined. On the other hand, public bills deal with general matters and apply to the entire nation. They are often controversial. Major public bills usually receive significant media coverage. Major public bills ac count for about 30 percent of the bills passed in each term of Congress. They may be debated for months before they become law. Joint resolutions may correct an error in an earlier law, for example, or appropriate money for a special purpose. Concurrent Resolutions Another type of resolution is a concurrent resolution. Concurrent resolutions cover matters requiring the action of the House and Senate, but on which a law is not needed. Both houses of Congress must pass concurrent resolutions. Riders Bills and resolutions usually deal with only one subject, such as civil rights or veterans benefits. Sometimes, however, a rider is attached to a bill. A rider is a provision on a subject other than the one covered in the bill. Lawmakers attach riders to bills that are likely to pass, although presidents have sometimes vetoed such bills because of a rider they did not like. Such a bill resembles a Christmas tree loaded with ornaments. Christmas tree bills sometimes pass because of the essential nature of the underlying bill. Why So Few Bills Become Laws Less than 10 percent of all bills introduced in Congress be come public laws. Why so few One reason is that the lawmaking process itself is very long and complicated. If you see a need for a law, you can write a bill and ask a representative or senator to introduce it for consideration. A sponsor will work to put your bill in the prop er form for introduction. The sponsor may also make changes in your bills content to increase its chances for passage. You may also contact other members of Congress to request their support for your legislation. Brainstorm to discover a problem that might be solved by national legislation and write a description of it. 180188 CH07S1860053 12104 249 AM Page 183 study found that more than 100 specific steps may be involved in passing a law. Thus, at many points in the lawmaking process a bill can be delayed, killed, or changed. This process has two important implications. First, it means that groups that op pose a bill have an advantage over those that sup port it. Opponents can amend the bill or kill it at many steps along the way. Second, because the lawmaking process has so many steps, sponsors of a bill must be willing to bar gain and compromise with lawmakers and interest groups. Compromise is the only way to get support to move a bill from one step to the next. Without strong support, most major bills have little chance of becoming law. Another reason so few bills become law is that lawmakers sometimes introduce bills they know have no chance of ever becoming law. Members of Congress may introduce such bills to go on record in support of an idea or policy or simply to attract the attention of the news media. Members may also want to satisfy an important group from their state or district. Introducing a bill can help lawmakers avoid criticism at reelection time. When the bill does not move forward, they can blame a committee or other lawmakers. Introducing a Bill The Constitution sets forth only a few of the many steps a bill must go through to be come law. The remaining steps have developed as Congress has grown in size and complexity and the number of bills has increased. The ideas for new bills come from private citizens, interest groups, the president, or officials in the executive branch. Critical Thinking Approximately 5 percent of all measures introduced in Congress become policy. If they do not think a bill should move ahead, other lawmakers will usually agree with them. Time is also a serious factor. Lawmakers have heavy workloads and must depend on the judgment of their peers. During a hearing, the committee listens to testimony from witnesses who may include experts on the subject of the bill, government officials, or representatives of interest groups concerned with the bill. Hearings are supposed to be an opportunity for Congress to gather information on the bill. Most detailed information about the bill, however, comes from research done by the committee staff. Skillful chairpersons may use hearings to influence public opinion for or against a bill or to test the political acceptability of a bill. Hearings can also help focus public attention on a problem or give interest groups a chance to present their opinions. In addition, hearings are often the best point in the lawmaking process to influence a bill. It is during hearings that letters, telegrams, and emails from interested citizens can have their greatest impact on a bill. Committees may also broadcast hearings over the Internet and allow visitors to email questions to committee members. Committees also use their Web home pages to make committee reports, documents, and other information available to Web users. In this type of session, committee members go through the bill section by section, making any changes they think the bill needs. A majority vote of the committee is required for all changes that are made to the bill. Rather, whips are leaders who make sure party members vote along with the rest of the party on bills. The term was originally used in the British House of Commons. Only a member of Congress, however, can introduce a bill in either house of Congress. To introduce a bill in the Senate, the presiding officer must first recognize the senator who then formally presents the bill. Bills introduced in the House and Senate are printed and distributed to lawmakers. In the House, the first bill is H.R.1, the second bill is H.R.2, and so on. This process is the first reading of the bill. Committee chairpersons may send the bill to a subcommittee. To reject a bill, committee members can ignore it and simply let it die, a process called pigeonholing, or they can kill the bill by a majority vote. When accepting a bill, a committee can first completely rewrite it, make changes, or recommend that it be adopted as is before sending it back to the House or Senate for further action.

Critical Thinking At what point in Congress is a bill most closely examined 185 180188 CH07S1860053 12104 250 AM Page 186 Voting Electronically Analyzing Votes The electronic voting system in the House displays each representatives name and vote on the wall of the chamber. Representatives insert a plastic card in a box fastened to the chairs to vote yea, nay, or present. When do you think a representative would vote present Reporting a Bill When all the changes have been made, the committee votes either to kill the bill or to report it. To report the bill means to send it to the House or Senate for action. Along with the revised bill, the committee will send to the House or Senate a written report the committee staff has prepared. This report is important. It explains the committees actions, describes the bill, lists the major changes the committee has made, and gives opinions on the bill. The report is often the only document available to lawmakers or their staffs as they decide how to vote on a bill. Why would a committee report a bill but not recommend pas sage This happens extremely rarely. Floor Action The next important step in the lawmaking process is the debate on the bill on the floor of the House and Senate. Voting on the bill fol lows the debate. As you may recall, both houses have special procedures to schedule bills for floor action. The pros and cons of the bill have been argued in the committee hearings and are already well known to those with a real interest in the bill. During the floor debate, the bill receives its second reading. A clerk reads the bill section by section. After each section is read, amendments may be offered. Amendments range from the introduction of major changes in a bill to the correction of typo graphical errors. Opponents of the bill sometimes propose amendments to slow its progress through Congress or even to kill it. One strategy opponents use is to load it down with so many objectionable amendments that it loses support and dies. In both the House and the Senate amendments are added to a bill only if a majority of the members present approves them. Voting on Bills After the floor debate, the bill, including any proposed changes, is ready for a 180188 CH07S1860053 12104 250 AM Page 187 Seal of the U.S. Congress vote. A quorum, or a majority, of the members must be present. The House or Senate now receives the third reading of the bill. A vote on the bill is then taken. Passage of a bill requires a majority vote of all the members present. House and Senate members can vote on a bill in one of three ways. The second way of voting is by a standing vote, or division vote, in which those in favor of the bill stand and are counted and then those opposed stand and are counted. The House also uses a fourth method called a record ed vote, in which members votes are recorded electronically and displayed on panels in the House chamber. Final Steps in Passing Bills To become law a bill must pass both houses of Congress in identical form. A bill passed in the House of Representatives often differs at first from a Senates bill on the same subject. Conference Committee Action If one house will not accept the version of a bill the other house has passed, a conference committee must work out differences between the versions. They usually come from the House and Senate committee members that handled the bill originally. The conferees work out the differences between the two bills by arranging compromises. A majority of the members of the conference committee from each house drafts the final bill, called a conference re port. Once accepted, this bill can be submitted to each house of Congress for final action. Presidential Action on Bills Article I1 of the Constitution states that Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it be comes a Law, be presented to the President of the United States . The president may sign the bill, and it w ill become law. The president may also keep the bill for 10 days without signing it. If Congress is in session, the bill will become law without the presidents signature. Most of the time, however, presidents sign the bills that Congress sends them. Vetoing Bills The president can also reject a bill with a veto. In a veto the president refuses to sign the bill and returns it to the house of Congress in which it originated, along with reasons for the veto. The president may also kill a bill passed during the last 10 days Congress is in session by refusing to act on it. This veto is called a pocket veto. If this happens, the bill becomes law.

Another section of this database provides the full text of the Congressional Record, committee reports, summaries of bills and updates on their status as they move through the legislative process, and the history of bills. Bills do not appear in the database until they are published in an official version by the Government Printing Office. As a result, drafts of bills, committee recommendations, and the chair mans mark, the version of a bill as it goes through a markup session, are not available.
