S e c t i o n 2 S e c t i o n 2 Taxing and Spending Bills Today, running the national government Readers Guide costs about 2 trillion a year. The government could not operate successfully without money to carry out its many programs and services. Almost all important work on tax laws occurs in the House Ways and Means Commit tee. The Ways and Means Committee decides whether to go along with presidential requests for tax cuts or increases. It also makes the numerous rules and regulations that determine who w ill pay how much tax. Some of these rulings are very simple while others are more complex. It also decides what kind of tax benefit businesses can claim for building new factories. This rule meant that only members of the Ways and Means Committee could have a direct hand in writing a tax bill. Other House members accepted this closed rule procedure on tax bills for several reasons. Floor amendments, they argued, might upset the fair and balanced legislation recommended by the committee. In the 1970s House members revolted against the Ways and Means Committee. In 1973 the House allowed members to amend a tax bill on the floor. In the Senate no closed rule exists, and tax bills often do become collections of amendments. Many tax bills are amended so often on the Senate floor they become Christmas tree bills similar to appropriations bills that include many riders. The Senates Role in Tax Legislation All tax bills start in the House. Article I, Section 7,1 of the Constitution, however, says, The Senate may propose amendments . Because of this pro vision, the Senate often tries to change tax bills the House has passed. As a result, many people view the Senate as the place where interest groups can get House tax provisions they do not like changed or eliminated. Like the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee is powerful. Although the Senate Finance Committee has subcommittees, the full committee does most of the work on tax bills. As a result, the chairperson of the Finance Committee is an extremely important figure. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774 799. In Article I, Section 9, the Constitution states, No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of except by appropriations made by law. 1 Thus, Congress must pass laws to appropriate money for the federal government. Suppose the president signs a bill to build recreational facilities in the inner cities. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774 799. This first step in the legislation is an authorization bill. For example, one provision of this law limits the amount of money that can be spent on the program to 30 million a year. Each year the president presents his budget to Congress. There the appropriations committees create their own appropriations bills. In the mid 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt convinced Congress to appropriate funds to a relief program for the unemployed. The Appropriations Committees The House and Senate appropriations committees and their subcommittees handle appropriations bills. During the budget hearings, these officials explain why they need the money they have requested. Each year agency officials must return to Congress to request the money they need to operate in the coming year. In this way law makers have a chance to become familiar with the federal agencies and their programs. In addition, powerful interest groups try hard to influence Congress and the appropriations sub committees to give these agencies all the money they request. Uncontrollable Expenditures The House and Senate appropriations committees, however, do not have a voice in all the current spending of the federal government. Some of these expenditures are known as entitlements because they are social programs that continue from one year to the next. A Social Security card .
