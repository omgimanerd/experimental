S e c t i o n 2 S e c t i o n 2 Taxing and Spending Bills Today, running the national government Readers Guide costs about 2 trillion a year. The government could not operate successfully without money to carry out its many programs and services. Almost all important work on tax laws occurs in the House Ways and Means Commit tee. The Ways and Means Committee decides whether to go along with presidential requests for tax cuts or increases. It also makes the numerous rules and regulations that determine who w ill pay how much tax. Some of these rulings are very simple while others are more complex. It also decides what kind of tax benefit businesses can claim for building new factories. This rule meant that only members of the Ways and Means Committee could have a direct hand in writing a tax bill. Other House members accepted this closed rule procedure on tax bills for several reasons. Floor amendments, they argued, might upset the fair and balanced legislation recommended by the committee. In the 1970s House members revolted against the Ways and Means Committee. In 1973 the House allowed members to amend a tax bill on the floor. In the Senate no closed rule exists, and tax bills often do become collections of amendments. Many tax bills are amended so often on the Senate floor they become Christmas tree bills similar to appropriations bills that include many riders. The Senates Role in Tax Legislation All tax bills start in the House. Article I, Section 7,1 of the Constitution, however, says, The Senate may propose amendments . Because of this pro vision, the Senate often tries to change tax bills the House has passed. As a result, many people view the Senate as the place where interest groups can get House tax provisions they do not like changed or eliminated. Like the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee is powerful. Although the Senate Finance Committee has subcommittees, the full committee does most of the work on tax bills. As a result, the chairperson of the Finance Committee is an extremely important figure. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774 799. In Article I, Section 9, the Constitution states, No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of except by appropriations made by law. 1 Thus, Congress must pass laws to appropriate money for the federal government. Suppose the president signs a bill to build recreational facilities in the inner cities. See the following footnoted materials in the Reference Handbook 1. The Constitution, pages 774 799. This first step in the legislation is an authorization bill. For example, one provision of this law limits the amount of money that can be spent on the program to 30 million a year. Each year the president presents his budget to Congress. There the appropriations committees create their own appropriations bills. In the mid 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt convinced Congress to appropriate funds to a relief program for the unemployed. The Appropriations Committees The House and Senate appropriations committees and their subcommittees handle appropriations bills. During the budget hearings, these officials explain why they need the money they have requested. Each year agency officials must return to Congress to request the money they need to operate in the coming year. In this way law makers have a chance to become familiar with the federal agencies and their programs. In addition, powerful interest groups try hard to influence Congress and the appropriations sub committees to give these agencies all the money they request. Uncontrollable Expenditures The House and Senate appropriations committees, however, do not have a voice in all the current spending of the federal government. Some of these expenditures are known as entitlements because they are social programs that continue from one year to the next. Checking for Understanding 1.

Determine what evidence the author presents. 5. Compare the information with other sources to see if they support or contradict each other. Learning the Skill Thomas Jefferson Practicing the Skill Read the excerpt below. It defines the nature of the Senate. Then answer the questions that follow. Why, asked Washington, did you pour that coffee into your saucer To cool it, Jefferson replied. Even so, responded Washington, we pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it. That the Senate was intended to be the more deliberative and reasoning of the two chambers is well known. In designing the Senate, the Framers chose institutional George Washington 1.

Prepare a short report analyzing one of the letters. They must also decide how to vote on controversial issues and when to make speeches explaining their views. In a single session, members may cast votes on a thousand issues. Who influences the lawmakers Key Terms lobbyist, lobbying Find Out How closely should the votes of members of Congress reflect the opinions of their constituents What factors must a member of Congress weigh when deciding whether to support the views of an interest group or of the president Understanding Concepts Political Processes What specific groups and individuals influence the legislators decisions Influences on Lawmakers A great many factors influence a lawmakers decisions. Sometimes the very nature of the issue determines the factors that w ill influence lawmakers most. For example, on a controversial issue such as the Second Amendment right to own a gun, a lawmaker may pay attention to the voters back home, no matter what his or her own beliefs may be. On issues that have little direct effect on their home states or districts, most lawmakers are likely to rely on their own beliefs or on the advice and opinions of other lawmakers. Congressional staff members also influence lawmakers decisions in Congress. They can do this in several ways. One way is by controlling the information on which lawmakers base their decisions. Voters say they want their lawmakers to follow constituents wishes on the issues and enact laws that reflect their needs and opinions. Most voters, however, do not take the trouble to find out how their senators and representatives cast their votes in Congress. Sometimes voters are not even aware of all the issues lawmakers must decide and vote on. They may demand that the lawmaker explain votes that turned out to be unpopular back home. A legislator running for reelection may call attention to his or her votes on certain measures in order to attract constituents support. What does the cartoonist seem to be saying about who influences a legislators vote As a result, voters who might otherwise not know how the lawmaker voted are told how well he or she paid attention to the folks back home. As a result, lawmakers try to find out what the voters back home are concerned about well before an election. One method is to make frequent trips home to learn the local voters concerns. Senators and representatives make dozens of trips to their home districts each year. These supporters also help lawmakers keep in touch with events back home. The Influence of Parties Almost every member of Congress is either a Republican or a Democrat. In many cases, knowing which political party members of Congress belong to will help predict how they will vote on major issues. Party Voting Both Democrats and Republicans tend to vote with their parties on bills. In the House of Representatives, members vote with their party more than 70 percent of the time. Party voting is much stronger on some issues than on others. On issues relating to government intervention in the economy, party members tend to vote the same way. Party voting is usually weaker on foreign policy issues because the two parties often do not have fixed positions on international questions. The Importance of Parties Republicans or Democrats vote with their parties because members of each party are likely to share the same general beliefs about public policy. In general, Republican members of Congress are likely to support lower taxes, less government spending, local and state rather than federal solutions to problems, and policies that support businesses and corporations and limit government intervention in the economy. Another reason for party voting is that most lawmakers do not have strong opinions about every issue on which they vote. They cannot know enough about all the issues to make informed decisions about every bill. Therefore, they often seek advice on how to vote from fellow party members who know more about an issue than they do. Voting Along Party Lines Political Processes Political parties greatly influence legislators voting decisions. How may congressional party leaders persuade lawmakers to support the party position Messages From Home Lawmakers also pay attention to the messages pouring into their offices every day. Staff members screen the lawmakers mail to learn what issues concern voters the most. Not all messages carry equal weight. Most lawmakers are only interested in messages that come from voters in their district or state or from interest groups of special concern to them. Sending an email to your lawmaker is one of the easiest ways to communicate with him or her. Surveys and Polls Many lawmakers send questionnaires to their constituents asking for their opinions on various issues. As an election draws near, lawmakers w ill often hire professional pollsters to conduct opinion surveys among the voters of their districts. Often, party leaders support the presidents program if the president is a member of the same party. Congressional party leaders such as the Senate majority leader or the Speaker of the House usually use the power of persuasion. These leaders do not expect to get their way all the time. Some presidents work harder than others at gaining sup port in Congress, and some are more successful in getting Congress to pass their programs. In late 1990 and early 1991, for example, President Bush deployed United States troops to Saudi Arabia. More than 6 months of military buildup followed, in which the United States government attempted to force Iraq out of Kuwait. Congress let the president take the lead in responding to Iraq. President Bush took every opportunity to express his views in the press and on television. With growing public support for military action behind the president, Congress voted to approve military action in the Persian Gulf. Presidential influence, in this instance of pol icy making, had tremendous influence. Presidents may also use their powers to influence individual members of Congress. They can give or withhold support of lawmakers. Anthony. Her efforts also took her to Washington, D.C., to see the statue and speak at a Raise the Statue rally. Her campaign did not go unnoticed by national legislators. Anthony 194199 CH07S3860053 12104 252 AM Page 198 Vietnam War. To support his viewpoint, Church showed President Johnson a newspaper column written by journalist Walter Lippmann criticizing the war. All right, Johnson said, the next time you need a dam for Idaho, you go ask Walter Lippmann. Since the early 1900s, many presidents have tried to increase their influence over Congress and the lawmaking process, and they have succeeded. In more recent years Congress has taken steps to limit the presidents influence, letting Congress remain a more autonomous legislative body. The Influence of Interest Groups The representatives of interest groups, called lobbyists, are another important influence on Congress. Lobbyists try to convince members of Congress to support policies favored by the groups they rep resent. Their efforts to persuade officials to support their point of view is called lobbying. In addition, lobbyists work for groups that sometimes form to support or to oppose a specific issue. They visit lawmakers in their offices or in the lobbies of the Capitol and try to persuade them to support their position. They encourage citizens to write to members of Congress on the issues they favor or oppose. Interest groups and their lobbyists also focus their attention on congressional committees. For example, farm groups concentrate their attention on influencing the committees responsible for laws on agriculture. Labor unions focus their effort on committees dealing with labor legislation and the economy. 1. 4. Checking for Understanding 1. Main Idea Using a graphic organizer like the one to the right, identify four ways lawmakers can keep in touch with voters opinions. 2. Define lobbyist, lobbying. 3. 4. On which type of issues do lawmakers tend to pay less attention to voter opinion 5. What influence does the president have on Congress Lawmakers 3. Summarize how the group attempts to influence legislators. The project provided additional justification for another major project, the space shuttle. By late 1996 President Clinton confirmed that the manned mission to Mars project was dead. Instead, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration began preparing a vast armada of robots to send to the red planet. In 1997, the first robot landed on Mars and sent back dramatic images and extensive data. A human mission would have cost 500 billion. Scientists also plan to use the station for biological experiments. U.S. There are risks, however. In 2003, tragedy struck the shuttle Columbia when it blew apart on reentry into the atmosphere, killing all seven crew members. The proposed budget is for 94 billion over a 15year period. Debate Discuss the issue in class. Allow time for two people on either side of the issue to prepare short speeches to present to the class. Then have the class vote and record the results. Discuss the outcome of the vote. Second, they must make sure that their district or state gets its share of federal money for projects such as new post offices, highways, and contracts. These two duties are not new to members of Congress, but in recent years these duties have become increasingly important. As the national government has grown, they have become a time consuming part of the lawmakers job. One House member put it this way, Rightly or wrongly, we have become the link between the frustrated citizen and the very involved federal government in citizens lives . We continually use more and more of our staff time to handle citizens complaints. Typical requests include (1) A soldier would like the Army to move him to a base close to home because his parents are ill. The agency says the veteran failed to fill out and return a certain form. The veteran says he never got the form, but he wants the life insurance. A representative from New York, for example, was asked to fix a speeding ticket. Another member received a call asking what the lawmaker was going to do about the shortage of snow shovels at a local hardware store during a blizzard. In most instances the caseworkers are able to handle the requests for help themselves. Sometimes the problem can be solved with a simple question from a caseworker to the agency involved. At other times, however, the senator or representative may have to get directly involved. Purposes of Casework Why do lawmakers spend so much of their time on casework Law makers are involved in casework because it serves three important purposes. First, casework helps lawmakers get reelected. Lawmakers know that helping voters with problems is part of what they can do for the people in their states or districts. As a result, many lawmakers actually look for casework. Many representatives have vans that drive through their districts as mobile offices to keep watch on problems back home. Third, casework provides a way for the average citizen to cope with the huge national government. Public Works Legislation Every year, through public works bills, Congress appropriates billions of dollars for a variety of local projects. Such government projects can bring jobs and money into a state or district. The idea is that a member of Congress has dipped into the pork barrel (the federal treasury) and pulled out a piece of fat (a federal project for his or her district). Sometimes such legislation draws criticism. These contracts are a vital source of money and jobs and can radically affect the economy of a state. Every year federal agencies such as the Department of Defense spend billions of dollars to carry out hundreds of government projects and programs. For example, when the Air Force decided to locate a new project at one of its bases in Utah, almost 1,000 jobs and millions of dollars came into the state. Lawmakers often compete for such valuable 200209 CH07S4860053 12104 256 AM Page 203 Distributing the Pork federal grants or contracts. Lawmakers, however, may try to influence agency decisions in several ways. They may pressure agency officials to give a favorable hearing to their states re quests. Many lawmakers assign one or more of their staff members to act as specialists in contracts and grants.

In this activity, you will take a bill through the process to create your own law. The activity will help you understand the lawmaking process in both houses of Congress and demonstrate the role that compromise plays in getting a bill passed. You may want to reread pages 181188 before you begin. The leader of each house should appoint each member to one of three committees. The leader will give each committee one bill for which it will be responsible. Each committee should choose a recorder to keep track of the progress and changes made to the bill. Members of each committee should also select a chairperson for their committee. The chairperson will be responsible for organizing the agenda for the committee meeting, assigning tasks, presiding over the meeting, and conducting votes. If available, you can also use blank transparencies and an overhead projector. These proposals might deal with the arrangement of seating, the use of the bulletin board, orderliness of materials on shelves, room decorations, and so on. Have the recorders from the House and the Senate write down each suggestion in the form of a bill for that house. Number the bills appropriately as explained in the text on page 184. Moving to Committee Groups 2 and 3 Senators and representatives should adjourn to separate areas of the class room. The recorders should then read the text of their three bills out loud. The members of all three committees should now reconvene as the Senate or House to hold debate on each bill. The leader of each house should preside over the debate, allowing one person at a time to speak. Changes (amendments) can still be made to the bills if a majority of members vote to do so. Calling Witnesses Groups 1, 2, and 3 The chairperson for each committee should call for a hearing and invite one witness to present his or her opinion on the bill. Group 1 Before the hearing, the witnesses should meet to divide up the bills being introduced. S E V I T A T N E S E R P E R F O E S U O H Y S E T R U O C 206 A bill must be dropped into the House hopper to be considered for legislative action. Each house should take a vote of its members to determine if the bill will pass or be defeated in its amended form. A roll call of each persons vote should be recorded. Presenting the Bill Each bill that passes through both houses should be for warded to the president (teacher) for action in written form. If the president vetoes a bill, the House and Senate may vote again to override the veto, or let the veto stand. On an overhead projector, display the original form of each bill in each house, along with the final versions. You may want to hold a class discussion on the following questions. Questions for Discussion 1. What improvements were made by the changes in each bill 2. If any of the bills were killed in committee, why did this happen 3. What disagreements in your committee were resolved by compromise 4. At what point in the lawmaking process is a bill most likely to be changed the most 6. C h a p t e r 7 C h a p t e r 7 Assessment and Activities 5. 6. Witnesses usually offer testimony in a committee _____ regarding a specific bill. 7. Under a _____, House members were forbid den to offer amendments to tax bills from the floor. 8. _____ is when Congress passes laws to appropriate money for local federal projects. 9. The president gives a _____ by not signing a bill during the last 10 days Congress is in session. 10. _____ set up federal programs and specify how much money may be appropriated for those programs. Recalling Facts 1. Describe the two types of bills that may be introduced and three types of resolutions that may be passed in Congress. 2. What are four actions a president may take on a bill 3. What role does the House Ways and Means Committee play in tax legislation 4. What factors influence lawmakers when they consider legislation 5. A _____ is money that citizens and businesses pay to support the government. 2. _____ is a congressional task that involves helping constituents with problems. 3. A _____ is an often controversial provision tacked on to a bill pertaining to a different subject. 4. Interest on the national debt and Social Security payments are examples of _____. Making Inferences Use the graphic organizer below to show three characteristics that help a bill make its way through the lawmaking process.

He said he might call back. 1. What is the Political Inaction Committee referred to in the cartoon 2. How is the Political Inaction Committee different from other interest groups 3. Why is this situation unrealistic 2. Drawing Conclusions Why is Congress reluctant to appropriate the full amount of money an agency requests Analyzing Primary Sources During the 1930s, President Franklin D. In the fireside chat excerpted below, Roosevelt explains why the New Deal did not take power away from Congress. Read the excerpt and answer the questions that follow. A prompt program applied as quickly as possible seemed to me not only justified but imperative to our national security . The members of Congress realized that the methods of normal times had to be replaced in the emergency by measures which were suited to the serious and pressing requirements of the moment. There was no actual surrender of power, Congress still retained its constitutional authority . The function of Congress is to decide what has to be done and to select the appropriate agency to carry out its will . The only thing that has been happening has been to designate the President as the agency to carry out certain of the purposes of the Congress. 1. Why do you think the president was careful to specify that Congress had not surrendered its constitutional power Participating in Local Government Obtain a copy of a bill being considered in your state from your state representative or senator. Decide what changes you would suggest in the bill. Forward these suggestions to your representative or senator and ask for a response.
