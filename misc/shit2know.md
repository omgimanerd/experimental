# SWEN 261 Final Exam: the bullshit class

- Interface Design Golden Rules:
  - Place the user in control
  - Reduce the user's memory load
  - Make the interface consistent
- Refactoring:
  - Changes internal structure for maintainability without changing external
    behavior.
  - Should be done any time design can be improved.
  - Any time the code smells weird
- Code Inspections
  - Find defects
  - Familiarize with codebase
  - Enforces uniform design and coding standards
  - Learn coding practice
  - Improved communication
- UML multiplicity
  - `m..n`: range from m to n
  - `m..*`: m or greater
- Sequence Diagram
  - Actor
  - Object
  - Lifeline
  - End of life
  - Activation box
  - Message
- Design Patterns
  - Creational: class instantiation
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Factory Method
    - Object Pool
    - Prototype
    - Singleton
  - Structural: class and object composition
    - Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - Decorator
    - Facade
    - Proxy
  - Behavioral: class and object communication
    - Chain of responsibility
    - Command
    - Interpreter
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Observer
    - State
    - Strategy
    - Template method
  - Four Parts of a Pattern
    - Pattern Name
    - Problem
    - Solution
    - Consequences
  - Advantages
    - Well described solutions that are thought out
    - Shared vocabulary
    - Concise language
    - Abstract
- Risk
  - probability * severity
  - project risks vs technical risks: project risks threaten project plan,
    technical risks threaten implementation and quality
  - Risk Avoidance, Risk Monitoring, Risk Management, Contingency Planning
  - Vendor risks: failure of vendor to provide support
  - Product risks: incompatibility with other systems
  - Process risk: time required to integrate is higher than expected
- Software Process Umbrella Activities
  - Project Tracking
  - Risk Management
  - Quality Assurance
  - Technical Reviews
  - Measurement
  - Configuration Management
  - Work Product Production
- Software Process Framework Activities
  - Communication: get requirements from stakeholders
  - Planning: create project plan for how work is to do
  - Modeling: develop analysis and design models
  - Construction: write and test code
  - Deployment: deliver product
- Testing:
  - Regression testing tests after changes to ensure nothing else was broken.
  - Integration testing puts together modules to test if shit works together.
  - Unit testing tests individual modules to see if they break when working on
    their own.
- Software Review:
  - Producer/Author: developer who is being reviewed
  - Leader/Moderator: runs review meeting, distributes and manages meeting
  - Reviewers/Inspectors: prepare for meeting, provide comments
  - Reader: reads through code artifact
  - Recorder/Scribe: takes notes during review process
- Agile Manifesto:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan
  - Reacts to change rapidly
- Software Quality Costs:
  - Prevention Costs: planning, technical reviews, testing, training
  - Appraisal Costs: inspection, maintenance, testing
  - Internal Failure Costs: rework, repair, failure mode analysis
  - External Failure Costs: complaint resolution, product return/replacement,
    customer support, warranty
- Good software has strong cohesion and loose coupling
- Bad software has anti-patterns, or improperly applied patterns
- Separation of concerns: each module is dedicated to its own function and
  can be tested and validated independently.
- Traceability is a type of relation that should exist between Use Cases,
  Requirements, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Test Cases, and other
  project items. It emables verification of an item's linkage to its source.
